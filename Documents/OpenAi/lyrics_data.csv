Brian_Poole__The_Tremeloes___Do_You_Love_Me,happy,"""Main Street Chapter XXXI LyricsI\nTheir night came unheralded. Kennicott was on a country call. It was cool but Carol huddled on the porch, rocking, meditating, rocking. The house was lonely and repellent, and though she sighed, “I ought to go in and read—so many things to read—ought to go in,” she remained. Suddenly Erik was coming, turning in, swinging open the screen door, touching her hand.\n\n“Erik!”\n\n“Saw your husband driving out of town. Couldn't stand it.”\n\n“Well——You mustn't stay more than five minutes.”\n\n“Couldn't stand not seeing you. Every day, towards evening, felt I had to see you—pictured you so clear. I've been good though, staying away, haven't I!”\n“And you must go on being good.”\n\n“Why must I?”\n\n“We better not stay here on the porch. The Howlands across the street are such window-peepers, and Mrs. Bogart——”\n\nShe did not look at him but she could divine his tremulousness as he stumbled indoors. A moment ago the night had been coldly empty; now it was incalculable, hot, treacherous. But it is women who are the calm realists once they discard the fetishes of the premarital hunt. Carol was serene as she murmured, “Hungry? I have some little honey-colored cakes. You may have two, and then you must skip home.”\n\n“Take me up and let me see Hugh asleep.”\n\n“I don't believe——”\n\n“Just a glimpse!”\n\n“Well——”\n\nShe doubtfully led the way to the hallroom-nursery. Their heads close, Erik's curls pleasant as they touched her cheek, they looked in at the baby. Hugh was pink with slumber. He had burrowed into his pillow with such energy that it was almost smothering him. Beside it was a celluloid rhinoceros; tight in his hand a torn picture of Old King Cole.\n\n“Shhh!” said Carol, quite automatically. She tiptoed in to pat the pillow. As she returned to Erik she had a friendly sense of his waiting for her. They smiled at each other. She did not think of Kennicott, the baby's father. What she did think was that some one rather like Erik, an older and surer Erik, ought to be Hugh's father. The three of them would play—incredible imaginative games.\n\n“Carol! You've told me about your own room. Let me peep in at it.”\n\n“But you mustn't stay, not a second. We must go downstairs.”\n\n“Yes.”\n“Will you be good?”\n\n“R-reasonably!” He was pale, large-eyed, serious.\n\n“You've got to be more than reasonably good!” She felt sensible and superior; she was energetic about pushing open the door.\n\nKennicott had always seemed out of place there but Erik surprisingly harmonized with the spirit of the room as he stroked the books, glanced at the prints. He held out his hands. He came toward her. She was weak, betrayed to a warm softness. Her head was tilted back. Her eyes were closed. Her thoughts were formless but many-colored. She felt his kiss, diffident and reverent, on her eyelid.\n\nThen she knew that it was impossible.\n\nShe shook herself. She sprang from him. “Please!” she said sharply.\n\nHe looked at her unyielding.\n\n“I am fond of you,” she said. “Don't spoil everything. Be my friend.”\n\n“How many thousands and millions of women must have said that! And now you! And it doesn't spoil everything. It glorifies everything.”\n\n“Dear, I do think there's a tiny streak of fairy in you—whatever you do with it. Perhaps I'd have loved that once. But I won't. It's too late. But I'll keep a fondness for you. Impersonal—I will be impersonal! It needn't be just a thin talky fondness. You do need me, don't you? Only you and my son need me. I've wanted so to be wanted! Once I wanted love to be given to me. Now I'll be content if I can give. . . . Almost content!\n\n“We women, we like to do things for men. Poor men! We swoop on you when you're defenseless and fuss over you and insist on reforming you. But it's so pitifully deep in us. You'll be the one thing in which I haven't failed. Do something definite! Even if it's just selling cottons. Sell beautiful cottons—caravans from China——”\n\n“Carol! Stop! You do love me!”\n\n“I do not! It's just——Can't you understand? Everything crushes in on me so, all the gaping dull people, and I look for a way out——Please go. I can't stand any more. Please!”\nHe was gone. And she was not relieved by the quiet of the house. She was empty and the house was empty and she needed him. She wanted to go on talking, to get this threshed out, to build a sane friendship. She wavered down to the living-room, looked out of the bay-window. He was not to be seen. But Mrs. Westlake was. She was walking past, and in the light from the corner arc-lamp she quickly inspected the porch, the windows. Carol dropped the curtain, stood with movement and reflection paralyzed. Automatically, without reasoning, she mumbled, “I will see him again soon and make him understand we must be friends. But——The house is so empty. It echoes so.”\n\nII\n\nKennicott had seemed nervous and absent-minded through that supper-hour, two evenings after. He prowled about the living-room, then growled:\n\n“What the dickens have you been saying to Ma Westlake?”\n\nCarol's book rattled. “What do you mean?”\n\n“I told you that Westlake and his wife were jealous of us, and here you been chumming up to them and——From what Dave tells me, Ma Westlake has been going around town saying you told her that you hate Aunt Bessie, and that you fixed up your own room because I snore, and you said Bjornstam was too good for Bea, and then, just recent, that you were sore on the town because we don't all go down on our knees and beg this Valborg fellow to come take supper with us. God only knows what else she says you said.”\n\n“It's not true, any of it! I did like Mrs. Westlake, and I've called on her, and apparently she's gone and twisted everything I've said——”\n\n“Sure. Of course she would. Didn't I tell you she would? She's an old cat, like her pussyfooting, hand-holding husband. Lord, if I was sick, I'd rather have a faith-healer than Westlake, and she's another slice off the same bacon. What I can't understand though——”\n\nShe waited, taut.\n\n“——is whatever possessed you to let her pump you, bright a girl as you are. I don't care what you told her—we all get peeved sometimes and want to blow off steam, that's natural—but if you wanted to keep it dark, why didn't you advertise it in the Dauntless, or get a megaphone and stand on top of the hotel and holler, or do anything besides spill it to her!”\n\n“I know. You told me. But she was so motherly. And I didn't have any woman——Vida 's become so married and proprietary.”\n\n“Well, next time you'll have better sense.”\n\nHe patted her head, flumped down behind his newspaper, said nothing more.\n\nEnemies leered through the windows, stole on her from the hall. She had no one save Erik. This kind good man Kennicott—he was an elder brother. It was Erik, her fellow outcast, to whom she wanted to run for sanctuary. Through her storm she was, to the eye, sitting quietly with her fingers between the pages of a baby-blue book on home-dressmaking. But her dismay at Mrs. Westlake's treachery had risen to active dread. What had the woman said of her and Erik? What did she know? What had she seen? Who else would join in the baying hunt? Who else had seen her with Erik? What had she to fear from the Dyers, Cy Bogart, Juanita, Aunt Bessie? What precisely had she answered to Mrs. Bogart's questioning?\n\nAll next day she was too restless to stay home, yet as she walked the streets on fictitious errands she was afraid of every person she met. She waited for them to speak; waited with foreboding. She repeated, “I mustn't ever see Erik again.” But the words did not register. She had no ecstatic indulgence in the sense of guilt which is, to the women of Main Street, the surest escape from blank tediousness.\n\nAt five, crumpled in a chair in the living-room, she started at the sound of the bell. Some one opened the door. She waited, uneasy. Vida Sherwin charged into the room. “Here's the one person I can trust!” Carol rejoiced.\n\nVida was serious but affectionate. She bustled at Carol with, “Oh, there you are, dearie, so glad t' find you in, sit down, want to talk to you.”\n\nCarol sat, obedient.\n\nVida fussily tugged over a large chair and launched out:\n\n“I've been hearing vague rumors you were interested in this Erik Valborg. I knew you couldn't be guilty, and I'm surer than ever of it now. Here we are, as blooming as a daisy.”\n\n“How does a respectable matron look when she feels guilty?”\n\nCarol sounded resentful.\n\n“Why——Oh, it would show! Besides! I know that you, of all people, are the one that can appreciate Dr. Will.”\n\n“What have you been hearing?”\n\n“Nothing, really. I just heard Mrs. Bogart say she'd seen you and Valborg walking together a lot.” Vida's chirping slackened. She looked at her nails. “But——I suspect you do like Valborg. Oh, I don't mean in any wrong way. But you're young; you don't know what an innocent liking might drift into. You always pretend to be so sophisticated and all, but you're a baby. Just because you are so innocent, you don't know what evil thoughts may lurk in that fellow's brain.”\n\n“You don't suppose Valborg could actually think about making love to me?”\n\nHer rather cheap sport ended abruptly as Vida cried, with contorted face, “What do you know about the thoughts in hearts? You just play at reforming the world. You don't know what it means to suffer.”\n\nThere are two insults which no human being will endure: the assertion that he hasn't a sense of humor, and the doubly impertinent assertion that he has never known trouble. Carol said furiously, “You think I don't suffer? You think I've always had an easy——”\n\n“No, you don't. I'm going to tell you something I've never told a living soul, not even Ray.” The dam of repressed imagination which Vida had builded for years, which now, with Raymie off at the wars, she was building again, gave way.\n\n“I was—I liked Will terribly well. One time at a party—oh, before he met you, of course—but we held hands, and we were so happy. But I didn't feel I was really suited to him. I let him go. Please don't think I still love him! I see now that Ray was predestined to be my mate. But because I liked him, I know how sincere and pure and noble Will is, and his thoughts never straying from the path of rectitude, and——If I gave him up to you, at least you've got to appreciate him! We danced together and laughed so, and I gave him up, but——This IS my affair! I'm NOT intruding! I see the whole thing as he does, because of all I've told you. Maybe it's shameless to bare my heart this way, but I do it for him—for him and you!”\n\nCarol understood that Vida believed herself to have recited minutely and brazenly a story of intimate love; understood that, in alarm, she was trying to cover her shame as she struggled on, “Liked him in the most honorable way—simply can't help it if I still see things through his eyes——If I gave him up, I certainly am not beyond my rights in demanding that you take care to avoid even the appearance of evil and——” She was weeping; an insignificant, flushed, ungracefully weeping woman.\n\nCarol could not endure it. She ran to Vida, kissed her forehead, comforted her with a murmur of dove-like sounds, sought to reassure her with worn and hastily assembled gifts of words: “Oh, I appreciate it so much,” and “You are so fine and splendid,” and “Let me assure you there isn't a thing to what you've heard,” and “Oh, indeed, I do know how sincere Will is, and as you say, so—so sincere.”\n\nVida believed that she had explained many deep and devious matters. She came out of her hysteria like a sparrow shaking off rain-drops. She sat up, and took advantage of her victory:\n\n“I don't want to rub it in, but you can see for yourself now, this is all a result of your being so discontented and not appreciating the dear good people here. And another thing: People like you and me, who want to reform things, have to be particularly careful about appearances. Think how much better you can criticize conventional customs if you yourself live up to them, scrupulously. Then people can't say you're attacking them to excuse your own infractions.”\n\nTo Carol was given a sudden great philosophical understanding, an explanation of half the cautious reforms in history. “Yes. I've heard that plea. It's a good one. It sets revolts aside to cool. It keeps strays in the flock. To word it differently: 'You must live up to the popular code if you believe in it; but if you don't believe in it, then you MUST live up to it!'”\n\n“I don't think so at all,” said Vida vaguely. She began to look hurt, and Carol let her be oracular.\n\nIII\n\nVida had done her a service; had made all agonizing seem so fatuous that she ceased writhing and saw that her whole problem was simple as mutton: she was interested in Erik's aspiration; interest gave her a hesitating fondness for him; and the future would take care of the event. . . . But at night, thinking in bed, she protested, “I'm not a falsely accused innocent, though! If it were some one more resolute than Erik, a fighter, an artist with bearded surly lips——They're only in books. Is that the real tragedy, that I never shall know tragedy, never find anything but blustery complications that turn out to be a farce?\n\n“No one big enough or pitiful enough to sacrifice for. Tragedy in neat blouses; the eternal flame all nice and safe in a kerosene stove. Neither heroic faith nor heroic guilt. Peeping at love from behind lace curtains—on Main Street!”\n\nAunt Bessie crept in next day, tried to pump her, tried to prime the pump by again hinting that Kennicott might have his own affairs. Carol snapped, “Whatever I may do, I'll have you to understand that Will is only too safe!” She wished afterward that she had not been so lofty. How much would Aunt Bessie make of “Whatever I may do?”\n\nWhen Kennicott came home he poked at things, and hemmed, and brought out, “Saw aunty, this afternoon. She said you weren't very polite to her.”\n\nCarol laughed. He looked at her in a puzzled way and fled to his newspaper.\n\nIV\n\nShe lay sleepless. She alternately considered ways of leaving Kennicott, and remembered his virtues, pitied his bewilderment in face of the subtle corroding sicknesses which he could not dose nor cut out. Didn't he perhaps need her more than did the book-solaced Erik? Suppose Will were to die, suddenly. Suppose she never again saw him at breakfast, silent but amiable, listening to her chatter. Suppose he never again played elephant for Hugh. Suppose——A country call, a slippery road, his motor skidding, the edge of the road crumbling, the car turning turtle, Will pinned beneath, suffering, brought home maimed, looking at her with spaniel eyes—or waiting for her, calling for her, while she was in Chicago, knowing nothing of it. Suppose he were sued by some vicious shrieking woman for malpractice. He tried to get witnesses; Westlake spread lies; his friends doubted him; his self-confidence was so broken that it was horrible to see the indecision of the decisive man; he was convicted, handcuffed, taken on a train——\n\nShe ran to his room. At her nervous push the door swung sharply in, struck a chair. He awoke, gasped, then in a steady voice: “What is it, dear? Anything wrong?” She darted to him, fumbled for the familiar harsh bristly cheek. How well she knew it, every seam, and hardness of bone, and roll of fat! Yet when he sighed, “This is a nice visit,” and dropped his hand on her thin-covered shoulder, she said, too cheerily, “I thought I heard you moaning. So silly of me. Good night, dear.”\n\nV\n\nShe did not see Erik for a fortnight, save once at church and once when she went to the tailor shop to talk over the plans, contingencies, and strategy of Kennicott's annual campaign for getting a new suit. Nat Hicks was there, and he was not so deferential as he had been. With unnecessary jauntiness he chuckled, “Some nice flannels, them samples, heh?” Needlessly he touched her arm to call attention to the fashion-plates, and humorously he glanced from her to Erik. At home she wondered if the little beast might not be suggesting himself as a rival to Erik, but that abysmal bedragglement she would not consider.\n\nShe saw Juanita Haydock slowly walking past the house—as Mrs. Westlake had once walked past.\n\nShe met Mrs. Westlake in Uncle Whittier's store, and before that alert stare forgot her determination to be rude, and was shakily cordial.\n\nShe was sure that all the men on the street, even Guy Pollock and Sam Clark, leered at her in an interested hopeful way, as though she were a notorious divorcee. She felt as insecure as a shadowed criminal. She wished to see Erik, and wished that she had never seen him. She fancied that Kennicott was the only person in town who did not know all—know incomparably more than there was to know—about herself and Erik. She crouched in her chair as she imagined men talking of her, thick-voiced, obscene, in barber shops and the tobacco-stinking pool parlor.\n\nThrough early autumn Fern Mullins was the only person who broke the suspense. The frivolous teacher had come to accept Carol as of her own youth, and though school had begun she rushed in daily to suggest dances, welsh-rabbit parties.\n\nFern begged her to go as chaperon to a barn-dance in the country, on a Saturday evening. Carol could not go. The next day, the storm crashed.Embed"", 'default'",0

Denis_Leary___Fat_Fucks,anger,"'Fat Fucks LyricsBeen to Vegas lately, any of you? Cause I was there for a couple of weeks, when we were on tour. Yeah, okay. You know what I noticed in Vegas? I noticed this one little thing: we have some fat fucking people in this country. It is out of control! Have you seen them sitting at the slot machines? They\'re so fat the stool\'s all the way up their ass, and they just sit there and have food delivered, and they eat and play the slots. ""AHHMUMFMUMF, CLANG!, AHHMUMMFFMUMMFF, CLANG! I need money, CLANG, CLANG, CLANG."" They fart, the stool flies across the room. These people make Elvis look anorexic, you know what I\'m talking about? Stop eating! I am fed up with the little denial phrases they have, too. ""I\'m not fat, I\'m husky."" Yeah. ""I\'m portly."" Ya ya ya ya. ""I\'m stout."" Oh, ok ok ok. ""I\'m big-boned."" You\'re big-assed! Dinosaurs are big-boned! Put the fork down. We gotta do something, because we all have fat people in our families. You know what, if we don\'t stop \'em soon, they\'re just gonna start blowin\' up, I swear to God. We\'re gonna have a country full of sumo wrestlers either way\n\nAnd they keep finding more denial stuff. There\'s a doctor now, I\'d like to see what size he is, a doctor in L.A. came up with a theory that being fat is actually a virus. Ah, I guess I\'m the asshole here, right? Cause every other virus we know about is a flesh-eating virus: the common cold, AIDS, cancer. But he\'s the found the one that makes ya bigger. Okay, yep yep yep yep yep. That\'s all the fat person in each family needs. Now we\'re at Thanksgiving with the fat person going, ""Well I\'m not actually overeating. AHHMUMFMUMF, I\'m trying to keep the virus at bay, AHHMUMFMUMF."" Look, I\'m trying to help here, okay? You have a choice: it\'s either me, or Richard Simmons coming over to your house, okay? He\'s gonna cry and shave his legs, I think you want me, I really do. I think I\'m the better choice. And there are definitely signs, folks, that you should stop eating. Let\'s make that very clear\n\nRemember the 7,000 pound guy on Long Island a couple years ago, had chest pains, and they had to cut a wall out of the house to get him to the house to get him to the hospital. Folks, that\'s the first sign. When you\'re calling the construction crew before you call the hospital, STOP FUCKING EATING! ""Look, I\'m having chest pains. Knock this wall down here. Yeah, get a crane and a dumpster to take me to the hospital. And then, uh, call ahead to the hospital, get some walls taken out over there, and get me a dozen donuts, cause this fucking virus is killing me, it really is.""\n\nSee, I could never be a fat guy. I\'ll tell you why. One simple reason: the first day I wake up and can\'t see my dick, I STOP EATING! OK? ""Honey, I can\'t see my dick. Give the dog some of the food, cause I\'m going to Ethiopia. I CAN\'T SEE IT! Can you see it? I can\'t feel it!"" Freak. I have to see my dick first thing in the morning. That\'s the kind of relationship we have. Wake up, first thing, ""Hey, how ya doing!"" ""Good, how ya doing?"" ""Terrific, you wanna jerk off now?"" ""Ya, why not!"" Oh yeah, jerkin\' off is like an aerobic thing for me now. I\'m forty, now I do it every day. I do it eeevery day. I\'ve even gone beyond porno, I\'m back to regular network TV. Oh yeah. People wonder why ""Caroline in the City"" is getting such big ratings. I\'ll tell you why! I know why!\n\nI love my dick. My dick loves me. I love my balls too, it\'s kind of a love triangle thing we have going on. I love my dick more than my balls, but don\'t tell my balls that because that would bum my balls out. Wait, let President Leary clarify that last statement: I love my dick, but I\'m no John Wayne Bobbitt, you know what I mean? Like, if my wife cuts my dick off, I\'m not telling anybody. Nobody\'s finding out! I don\'t care if the cops show up at my house, with the dick, ""Nope, no, not mine. No, I never had a dick. I\'m a eunuch, that\'s right. \'No Dick Leary,\' that\'s my nickname. I\'m actually saving up to buy a vagina, that\'s what I\'m doing right now. But thanks for dropping by, fellas. CLANG!""\n\nI also wanna make an announcment, that I am pro-tit all the way. President Leary is pro-tit all the way. I love tits. I would like to be the mayor of Tit Town if I could. I\'d like to drive a big truck full of tits down the Tit Turnpike right through the middle of Tit Town. I\'d like to have my own talk show about tits, ""Tit Talk"". That\'s how passionate I am about the tits, I love \'em all. I actually love the small tits better than the big tits because the big tits get all the attention. The peach and plum little hand-shaped tits, they\'re great. I love to look at \'em. ""How ya doin!"" talk to \'em, ""What\'s goin\' on? Look at me! I\'ve got my face next to a tit!"" Men are mollified by tits. We don\'t know why, we just are. We don\'t have to see naked tits to get mollified, we just freeze up even at the sight of cleavage. Waitress leans over the table the wrong way... That\'s how we can end war. Get the Good Year blimp, paint it up like a tit, put a nipple on it. Fly it over the Middle East during a confrontation, ""Look at the tit! Look at the tiiiiit! The tiiiiiiit!

Teeth and fingernails strip the shell clean, thread my buttons and beads. And if the house is sadder when I leave you on your own just build another home - stubborn Billy-goat! Bitter to the bone, chopping timber and stone\nForgive this request, see I\'m bleeding half to death. For days I drift and land in your hands, where all that I know is all I need to know. I take the pen and I write: ""You are anything other than kind.""\nThe son will gift the colour when the ashes are grey on our mother\'s face. Giving counsel and giving us a name, such a tender exchange. But if you\'re growing bitter as I lead you through the breeze just lead me to the field. Scatter petals and bury me in weeds. Chop a cross from a tree\nForgive this request, see I\'m bleeding half to death. For days I drift and land in your hands, where all that I know is all I need to know.

[laughs]\n\nThe doorbell sounds and Frasier goes to answer it as Daphne and\nMartin chat.\n\nDaphne: It\'s nice you feel so dedicated.\n\nMartin: It\'s a hobby.

He enters and hands the wine to Frasier.\nFrasier: Hello, Niles.\n\nNiles: Sorry I\'m late, Frasier. Just as we were leaving, Maris had a\nrun-in with a rude directory assistance operator and it\nshattered her calm.\n\nFrasier: Have you ever considered that maybe Maris is a bit high\nstrung?

All four close their eyes and hold\ntheir hands together. As Martin begins his prayer, Niles stares at\nDaphne as Eddie stares at Frasier. Daphne does not notice with her\neyes shut. However, Frasier notices Eddie\'s skin-creeping look.\n\nMartin: We thank you, Lord, for the food we\'re about to eat. You have\nblessed our table with your palm.

Daphne looks at Niles a little suspiciously\nas he begins the meal conversation.\n\nNiles: So Frasier, did you happen to read Derek Mann\'s column\ntoday? You were mentioned.\n\nFrasier: No, I missed it.\n\nNiles: Just as well, it wasn\'t flattering.\n\nFrasier: I still would have liked to have seen it anyway.\n\nNiles: Oh, why didn\'t you say so? [takes it out of his pocket]\n\nDaphne: If I may ask, who\'s Derek Mann?\n\nMartin: He writes that ""Mann About Town"" column for the Times.

Now, who would like some wine?\n\nDaphne: Oh, I\'ll have some.\n\nFrasier goes to pour some as Niles compliments Daphne.\n\nNiles: Daphne, this salad is exquisite.\n\nFrasier: [sitting down:] Now why would he say that?\n\nMartin: Must be the carrots, he always did like them.\n\nFrasier: Not the salad, Derek Mann. I mean, why would he write a thing\nlike that? I\'ve never done anything to him, the attack is\ntotally unwarranted. I\'m a healer, for God\'s sake.\n\nMartin: Oh, for crying out loud!\n\nFrasier: Dad, I have every right to feel upset about this - I will\nnot enjoy my dinner until this is where it belongs - in the\ntrash.\n\nFrasier goes to bin it as Niles tries to stop him.\n\nNiles: Oh, oh, there was an article in there I wanted to save.\n\nMartin: On what?\n\nNiles: Nothing.\n\nMartin: Come on, I\'m interested.\n\nNiles: Oh, let\'s drop it.\n\nMartin: Why can\'t you tell me?\n\nNiles: All right, it was all about Margaret Thatcher\'s secret for\ngrowing prize-winning zinnias. Are you happy?\nMartin: [beat] Not really.\n\nFADE OUT\n\nAct Card\nOH, YEAH...\n\nScene Two - Radio Station.\n\nThe following afternoon Frasier is taking a call on air in his booth\nas Roz listens.\n\nFrasier: All right, Lorraine. Now, calm down and try and listen to\nwhat I\'m going to say to you. Will you do that?\n\nLorraine: [v.o:] Okay.\n\nFrasier: All right, good girl. Now your problem...\n\nLorraine: [beep] Oh my gosh, another call waiting - someone else is\ntrying to get through. Do you mind if I take it?\n\nFrasier: No, no. Go right ahead. [she does] Well, certainly a very\ninteresting situation she\'s got herself into. Don\'t you\nthink so, Roz?\n\nRoz is busy eating and reading magazines. She has to quickly chew her\nfood, put down her books just for the simple:\n\nRoz: Yes.\n\nLorraine: Okay, I\'m back.\n\nFrasier: All right, Lorraine. Now listen very carefully to what I\'m\ngoing to tell you. Your problem seems...\n\nLorraine: [beep] Oh, I\'m sorry, I\'ll be right back.\n\nFrasier: For someone who\'s got so many problems she certainly is\npopular. [laughs]\n\nLorraine: Okay, go ahead Dr. Crane. I\'m here. [beep] Oh, I don\'t\nbelieve it - another call.\n\nFrasier: Hold it there, Lorraine. The reason why you want to take\nthat other call is the same reason that you want to change\nyour career and break up with your boyfriend. You\'re\nobsessed with what you think you\'re missing. The better\noffer, the call on the other line. Well, you\'ve got to take\none call at a time from now on. Fully explore and\nexperience each one in its turn and you\'ll be a stronger\nperson for it. Do you follow me, Lorraine?\n\nLorraine: Okay, I\'m back!\n\nFrasier: Thank you for your call. [hangs up] Well, we\'ve only got\ntwo minutes left, so I would like to end today\'s program on\na personal note. As some of you may know, yesterday I was\nmentioned in Derek Mann\'s ""Mann About Town"" column. He\nsaid, and I quote, ""I Hate Frasier Crane""... ""I Hate Frasier\nCrane"". [sarcastic:] What trenchant criticism. Move aside\nVoltaire, step back in the shadows H.L. Mencken, there\'s a\nnew kid in town. One can only wonder how many hours Derek\nMann sat in the glow of his computer screen before his\ntrembling fingers sprang to life and pecked out this chef\nt\'ouerve: ""I Hate Frasier Crane."" A lesser critic would\nhave wasted our time by presenting a well thought-out,\npoint by point, constructive critique of this show. No, not\nour Mr. Mann. So dear listeners, when Mr. Mann\'s column\narrives on your front doorstep - read it, enjoy it, but\nabove all, treasure it. For one day this man will be joining\nthe Pantheon of the immortals. And if we\'re lucky... it\'ll be\none day soon. I\'m Dr. Frasier Crane. [signs off]\n\nFrasier presses the off air button, and twirls his microphone around\nbefore blowing on it as if it were his weapon, then “holsters” it\nin his belt.\n\nFADE TO:\n\nAct Card\nYEAH!\n\nScene Three - Café Nervosa.\n\nThe following afternoon Frasier is drinking a coffee in the café with\nRoz when Niles enters and sits with him.\n\nNiles: Frasier, how funny running into you here.\n\nFrasier: I\'m always here.\n\nNiles: Yes well, you weren\'t here twenty minutes ago: have you seen\ntoday\'s ""Times""?\n\nFrasier: [knowing what\'s coming:] No.\n\nNiles: Lucky for you I saved you this copy. Take a look at Derek\nMann\'s column.\n\nFrasier: You know, this is the second time in as many days that you\nhave given me a paper. Have you ever considered getting\nyourself a route?\n\nNiles: [to Roz:] Hello, I don\'t believe we\'ve met.\n\nRoz: Yes we have, Niles, three or four times. Roz Doyle.\n\nNiles: Oh, of course. It was at the... it was during the... well, I\'m far\ntoo successful to feel awkward. Where did we meet?\n\nRoz: The radio station.\n\nNiles: Ah, I\'ll take your word for it. Nice to see you again. [then,\nto Frasier:] Mr. Mann heard your program yesterday.\n\nFrasier: So I see. [reading:] “Yesterday afternoon, Dr. Frasier Crane\ngot on my case for not giving him a point by point criticism\nof his radio show. Well, he asked for it, so here goes.”\n\nRoz: [noticing:] Oh my god, his entire column is about your show.\n\nNiles: Not very flattering either. Towards the end he even attacks\nyour ""dimwitted sidekick call screener.""\n\nRoz: [appalled:] That\'s me!\n\nNiles: Oh, now I remember you!\n\nFrasier: [reading:] “It\'s hard to say what I hate most about Crane\'s\nshow – his pompous, sanctimonious style, his constant self-\ncongratulatory references to his own life, or his voice: a mock-\nsympathetic tone so sickly sweet one wonders if the man\ngraduated from medical school or from some mind-controlling\ncult.”\n\nNiles: It\'s continued on twelve.\n\nFrasier: I\'ve read enough!\n\nWaiter: [asking:] Can I get you something?\n\nFrasier: [to Niles:] How can the man think something like that?\n\nWaiter: It\'s my job, I\'m a waiter.\n\nFrasier: We don\'t want anything, thank you.\n\nRoz: Frasier, I know this stinks, but in a couple of days it\'ll\n\nblow over.\n\nFrasier: Oh, perhaps you\'re right. As angry as it makes me, to\nretaliate would be to stoop to his level. So the best\nresponse is no response at all.\n\nFADE TO:\nScene Four - Radio Station.\n\nSoon after these comments he is already shouting into his microphone\nabout the recent newspaper report.\n\nFrasier: [angry:] “Pompous and sanctimonious,” am I?! Well, this Mann\ncharacter can\'t even write grammatical sentences! Every\nfive words there\'s one of his precious ""dot, dot, dots.""\nMust be because he likes writing all those dots with the\ncrayon he writes this drivel in!\n\nRoz, who looks like she has been listening to him rant for quite\na while, tries to steer him back to the show.\n\nRoz: Dr. Crane, on line two we have Stewart who\'s having a\nproblem with delayed gratification.\n\nFrasier: Well, he\'s just going to have to wait! I don\'t know who this\nDerek Mann thinks he is, but if he thinks he can hide behind\nhis newspaper like some sniveling schoolchild cowering\nbehind a tree, then I say let\'s expose this Derek Mann for\nwhat he is: not a man at all, but half a man! [to Roz:] Now\nwhat line did you say Stewart was on?\n\nRoz: He hung up.\n\nFrasier: Well, I\'m leaving all sorts of bodies in my wake today.\nLet\'s see who\'s on line five. [he presses button:] Hello,\nthis is Dr. Frasier Crane - I\'m listening.\n\nDerek: [v.o:] Good, because I was listening too.\n\nFrasier: And you are?\n\nDerek: Derek Mann.\n\nFrasier: [regretting:] I see.\n\nDerek: Look, nobody calls me half a man - especially some Ivy League\ntwit. So what do you say we settle this like men?\n\nFrasier: Are you implying that you want to fight me?\n\nDerek: I\'m not implying, I\'m saying.\n\nFrasier: Fight, as in a fist fight?\n\nDerek: [sarcastic:] No, I thought we might throw pies at each\nother! So are you up to it, or aren\'t you man enough?\n\nFrasier: [thinks] We\'ll be right back after these messages.\nFrasier signs off for commercials as we fade out.\n\nAct Two.\nScene One - Radio Station.\n\nThe scene resumes where we left off. The commercials have finished\nand Frasier gets back to his radio show.\n\nFrasier: And we\'re back. Well, we have a surprise caller on the line:\nDerek Mann.\n\nDerek: [v.o:] So what\'s it going to be, Crane, are you going to\nfight me or not?\n\nFrasier: Oh, you can\'t be serious.\n\nDerek: Just like I figured, you\'re chicken.\n\nFrasier: No, I just don\'t think that civilized people behave that\nway. You know, Roz, perhaps our listeners have an opinion\nabout that subject? Who do we have on the line?\n\nRoz: Well, lines one through eight are people who think you\'re chicken.\n\nDerek: You\'re chicken, Crane. Admit it!\n\nFrasier: I am not chicken!\n\nDerek: [squawks like a chicken]\n\nFrasier: We are mature thinking people, not cavemen!\n\nDerek: [squawks some more]\n\nFrasier: Alright, if you want a fight so bad, I\'ll give you a fight!\nYou just say the time and place!\n\nDerek: Kinsley square, right outside your office, by the old\nstatue. Noon tomorrow. Don\'t back out!\n\nFrasier: I won\'t! Don\'t you back out either because I know where your\noffice is too, and I know where you live, and I\'ll track you\ndown! Now who else out there wants a piece of me?!\n\nFADE TO:\nScene Card\nET TU, EDDIE?\nScene Two - Frasier\'s Apartment.\n\nThat evening Martin is searching through his old case as Daphne\npasses him.\n\nDaphne: Having a look at that old murder case again?\n\nMartin: Yeah, I\'ve dug out the old crime scene photos.\n\nDaphne: Well, don\'t be a greedy guts - let me have a look.\n\nDaphne has a look at the photo of the girl. After a while her psychic\npowers kick in.\n\nDaphne: Her name was Helen.\n\nMartin: Yeah, it was. [knowing her trick:] Ah, you must have seen it\non some of my papers I\'ve had lying around here.\n\nDaphne: No, I just got this feeling when I touched the picture.\n\nMartin: You\'re putting me on.\n\nDaphne: She had a lot of men in her life.\n\nMartin: No kidding: she was a hooker!\n\nDaphne: No, I mean she had four brothers.\n\nMartin: [surprised:] That\'s amazing. She did have four brothers.\nWhat else are you getting? Well, come on, tell me more.\n\nDaphne: I can\'t just turn it on and off like a faucet.\n\nMartin: Give it a try, will you? Please. What else are you getting?\n\nDaphne: Nothing. [suddenly:] No, wait. I see a man.\n\nMartin: Yeah?\n\nDaphne: A well-dressed man. He\'s wearing wing tips and a trench coat.\n\nMartin: Yeah? Yeah?\n\nDaphne: He\'s getting off an elevator... he\'s walking down a long\nhallway... she doesn\'t know he\'s coming... he\'s opening the\ndoor...\n\nAt this moment, a well-dressed man enters the apartment wearing wing\ntips and a trench coat - it\'s Frasier.\n\nFrasier: Hello, everyone.\n\nDaphne: Sometimes I get my signals crossed.\n\nFrasier: What\'s going on?\n\nMartin: Well - unless you killed a hooker when you were twelve -\nnothing much!\n\nDaphne: We heard your show today. I just loved the way you handled\nthat Derek Mann.\n\nMartin: You made your old man proud. Yet the best part was when he\nchallenged you to a fight and you stood right up to him.\n\nFrasier: [worried:] Yes I did, didn\'t I?\n\nMartin: I can\'t wait to see that.\n\nFrasier: Oh, I\'m not actually going to go through with it, dad.\n\nMartin: What are you talking about?\n\nFrasier: Well, I already won our little war of words. What would I\nstand to benefit by going through with actually going\nthrough with a fist fight?\n\nMartin: Frasier, maybe I\'m misunderstanding here... he challenged\nyou and you\'re backing down?\n\nFrasier: Well, mature people are supposed to use their intellect to\nsettle their differences.\n\nMartin: A man doesn\'t just turn his tail and run - that\'s not the\nway I brought you up.\n\nFrasier: Are you encouraging me to fight?\n\nMartin: You bet I am - you gave the guy your word.\n\nFrasier: Yes, but I didn\'t even know what I was saying - I hadn\'t even\nhad lunch yet.\n\nMartin: I might have known this would have happened. It\'s Billy Kreizel\nall over again.\n\nFrasier: What did you say?\n\nMartin: Something about a Billy Kreizel, I believe.\n\nFrasier: I can\'t believe you\'re dragging that up - that was thirty\nyears ago.\n\nDaphne: Who\'s this Billy Kreizel?\n\nFrasier: Oh, he was this kid in fifth grade that used to torment me!\n\nMartin: So one day Frasier made fun of Billy\'s crewcut.\n\nFrasier: Well, he started it by making fun of the elbow patches on my\nblazer!\n\nMartin: Well, the point is, they were supposed to meet for a fight\nafter school. Only ""Patches"" here didn\'t show up!\n\nFrasier: I had a clarinet lesson!\n\nMartin: You don\'t need to remind me of that! Billy\'s old man was a\ncop, too. Boy, the guys rode me about that excuse of yours for\nyears. Every time I couldn\'t make it out for a drink they\nused to say, ""What\'s the matter? You got a clarinet lesson?""\n\nDaphne: [wondering:] Couldn\'t you and Billy have met after the\nclarinet lesson?\n\nFrasier: Daphne, would you please excuse us for a moment!\n\nDaphne: [gets up:] I have a feeling I\'m going to be excused quite a\nlot in this house.\n\nShe exits to the kitchen.\n\nFrasier: [sarcastic:] Dad, I am sorry if I embarrassed you for not\nfighting Billy Kreizel thirty years ago. But the situation\nis not the same now.\n\nMartin: It\'s exactly the same.\n\nFrasier: I am an adult now, I\'ve been to medical school, I hold a\ncertain position in this city - I do not settle my\ndifferences with brawling.\n\nMartin: The man challenged you and you accepted.\n\nFrasier: Dad, I can\'t believe this. You won\'t be happy until I come\nhome with a black eye.\n\nMartin: I just want you to do what you said you were going to do.\nYou know, you can talk about your medical school, your\nintellect, your place in this city, but you know what? It\'s\nall one big clarinet lesson... I can\'t even look at you.\n\nMartin exits to the kitchen, angry with his son. Frasier is left with\nlittle dignity and looks at Eddie for a little support. However, even\nEddie turns his face away from him. Frasier can only sulk.\n\nFADE TO:\nScene Card\nREQUIEM FOR A LIGHTWEIGHT\n\nScene Three - Café Nervosa.\n\nThe next day, Frasier is preparing for the big fight whilst chatting\nwith Roz.\n\nRoz: So, I step out of the shower, I look out of the window and I\nnotice the garbage man looking right in at me. So I say,\n""Did you get a good look?"" And he says, ""Not completely,\nturn around."" Then he smiled, and he\'s missing a tooth,\nand that\'s when the romance went right out of it for me.\n\nFrasier: Roz, why are you telling me this story?\n\nRoz: I\'m trying to take your mind of the fact that in five\nminutes you\'re going to walk right out into that square and\nget your clock cleaned.\n\nFrasier: Well, has it ever occurred to you that I might actually win\nthis fight?\n\nRoz: Your shoe’s untied. [Frasier checks his tied shoes] If you\nfell for that one, you\'re going down and you\'re going down\nhard.\n\nNiles: [enters] Frasier, there\'s quite a crowd forming out there.\nSecretaries with bag lunches, business men, children with\nballoons...\n\nFrasier: All that\'s missing is a mariachi band.\n\nNiles: They\'re setting up.\n\nRoz: Well, I better go find a great place in the crowd. I\'ll be\noff to the left, Frasier, for when you tear his ear off and\nwant to throw it to a beautiful senorita.\nShe leaves the Café. Niles looks at Frasier.\n\nNiles: Frasier, as your brother and as your friend - why are you\ndoing this?\n\nFrasier: It\'s Billy Kreizel.\n\nNiles: [looking around:] Where?\n\nFrasier: [shakes head] He\'s not here, Niles. It\'s just that I ran away\nfrom him when I was ten.\n\nNiles: I remember.\n\nFrasier: You know, I\'ve been running ever since. You know, this is\nwhere it stops. I\'m not running anymore.\n\nNiles: What is it that makes us Crane boys such targets?\n\nAs he says this, he takes his nail file out of his coat pocket\nand buffs his nails. He blows on them and offers the file to\nFrasier which he refuses.\n\nFrasier: [sarcastic:] Chalk it up to random violence!\n\nNiles nods in agreement and exits the café. Martin enters.\n\nMartin: Hey, there.\n\nFrasier: Dad? What are you doing here?\n\nMartin: Look son, I said a couple of things last night that maybe\nwent over the line.\n\nFrasier: Look dad, if you were worried that you talked me into\nsomething that I wasn\'t ready to do – well, you\'re wrong.\nYou can relax. I took this on for myself.\n\nMartin: Good.\n\nFrasier: Who told you that I was going through with it, anyway?\n\nMartin: Oh, let\'s just say a father knows certain things about his son.\nThey smile. Daphne enters.\n\nDaphne: Good news, I parked in front of a broken meter. We\'re getting\na freebie. Well, good luck, Dr. Crane, with the fight.\n\nFrasier: Thank you, Daphne. Any psychic predictions on the outcome?\n\nDaphne: Actually, yes. But don\'t worry, I\'m frequently wrong.\n\nFrasier removes his jacket and tie. Niles comes in.\n\nNiles: Frasier, Frasier, there\'s something I want you to see.\n[points out of window:] There, the man standing to the left\nof the statue - I recognize his picture from the newspaper,\nthat\'s Derek Mann.\n\nFrasier: He\'s gigantic!\n\nDaphne: [looking out:] My God, you could show a movie on his back!\n\nMartin: Are you sure you want to go through with this?\n\nFrasier: Yes, yes I am.\n\nFrasier throws a few shadow punches to loosen himself up.\n\nMartin: Good, you\'ll be fine. Just remember this is a street fight\nand not a boxing match. So fight dirty and throw the first\npunch!\n\nDaphne: I found that a swift knee to the groin usually does the\ntrick. [cocky:] If you have any doubts, check with a fellow\nin Manchester named Nigel Tavers.\n\nNiles: [begins to leave:] Well, if we want an unobstructed view...\n\nFrasier: [stops him:] Look, I prefer if you guys stay here. You\'ll\nonly make me nervous.\n\nMartin: Whatever you want.\n\nThey all wish Frasier good luck. As he exits the mariachi band\nstrikes up. They all move over to the window to look out.\n\nMartin: They\'ve got a mariachi band out there!\n\nNiles: I\'ll have to get their card, I need someone for our summer\nbarbeque.\n\nDaphne: Oh look, they’re starting the fight.\n\nMartin: Nah, they’re just circling, sizing each other up. Come on,\nFrasier, if you\'re going to hit him, hit him now!\n\nThey all shout encouragements, then police sirens are heard.\n\nNiles: Is that the police?\n\nMartin: Yeah, what are they doing here?\n\nDaphne: They\'re breaking it up! Just when they were getting started.\n\nShouts are heard from the crowd hurling insults at the police force.\nThe officer marches Frasier right into the Café.\n\nFrasier: Alright, I\'ll come along peacefully - let me just get my\njacket.\n\nOfficer: Relax, I\'m not arresting you. But I\'m warning you that in\nthis town we don\'t settle our differences with street fights\n- no matter who you are.\n\nFrasier: Well thank you, officer, you\'ll have no more trouble from me.\n\nOfficer: Okay. [exits]\n\nFrasier: Dad, dad, did you see me? My hands are trembling, my chest\nis pounding, my mouth is all dry, my knees are like jello...\nGod, I feel great!\n\nMartin: You did good.\n\nFrasier: Yeah, I was out there. I was raring to go, you saw that...\n\nMartin: I know you were. You would have kicked his butt!\n\nDaphne: From here to Tacoma.\n\nNiles: [shouting:] I think we should celebrate! Everyone, a round\nof victory lattes on me.\n\nAs the gang celebrate, Martin walks up to the officer on the door.\n\nMartin: Thanks Harry, I owe you one.\n\nOfficer: No problem, Marty.\n\nMartin: You cut it pretty close, though. Another minute, then Frasier\nwould have been sidewalk litter. He would have been lunch\nmeat.\n\nOfficer: Say, some of the guys are getting together later at Duke’s.\nWhy don\'t you come along?\n\nMartin: Yeah, maybe I will. And you know why I will? Because the\nCrane boys don\'t take clarinet lessons anymore.\n\nOfficer: What the hell are you talking about?\n\nMartin: [embarrassed:] Oh that\'s right, you weren\'t in my precinct.\n\nCredits:\n\nFrasier\'s Apartment:\n\nEddie is sat on a chair staring at a picture of Frasier looking mad.\nHe doesn\'t take his eyes off him.Embed', 'default'",2

They\'re divided into different categories, so check them out and give your thoughts. I\'d like your guys\' help, if you\'re willing so hit me up or whatever.\n\nDREAM PROJECTS\nThese are the projects I\'d absolutely love to do if I made it. I\'ve always wanted to be a filmmaker and these projects are ones that I\'ve wanted and dreamed about doing for years and years and years.\n\nHUSTLE\nThis is one of the scripts I\'ve been writing for about a year or two now, and I\'ve given it several different names, but landed on \'Hustle\', and loved it. I\'m a big fan of the crime film genre and have followed it throughout its history, tracking back to the days it was ruled by such actors as Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney who by the way, are my two favorite actors throughout cinematic history. I wanted this film to be a tribute to some of my favorite directors of the past Frank Capra and Martin Scorsese in particular, my favorite actors of the past Bogart and Cagney specifically cited, my favorite films of the past Casablanca and The Godfather in specific, my favorite genres crime, action, and comedy in specific, and my favorite actors working right now who I specifically wrote the characters for and geared towards their personas, as well as personal touches such as past experiences and certain things I like and enjoy for example, this film would be set in Florida, a place I would like to live in the future. In terms of the cast, yes, I specifically wrote these characters to fit certain actors\' personas because I always loved the idea of all star ensembles, it fired my passion for cinema even more. And in recent years, we\'ve seen The Avengers films and American Hustle, among others, and when directors and screenwriters have everything going for them, the results are incredible. I always told myself if I made it, I wanted my first film to be with my favorite actors, and this is the plan. I also firmly believe in a line said by the legendary Scorsese himself, ""When I\'m making a film, I\'m the audience"". I want to make a movie that I truly enjoy and would want to see, but also give that same feeling and euphoria back to the audience. Now, this is what I\'m thinking in terms of the cast.\nDenzel Washington-leader of a crime organization named \'The Invisible Hand\'; very well respected, charismatic, but is impatient and has a temper\nMatt Damon-leader\'s right hand man; we later learn that he set everyone up and is turning each of the group members against each other\nChristian Bale-a loose cannon in the group; he\'s rich, but he\'s arrogant; he\'s married, but he sleeps around; he gets angry whenever anyone else tries to tell him how to live his life and is overprotective over what he already has but takes advantage of\nRobert Downey Jr.-the lawyer in the group; a self made man that\'s respectable, but impatient, and doesn\'t approve of some of the actions the group takes\nJeremy Renner-he\'s always caught in the middle of things and unsure of where he belongs, though he feels he finally found a place where he belongs and people who need him and care about him\nTom Hardy-a cocky, arrogant, brutal casino owner/business partner of The Invisible Hand that turns on them and turns out to be screwing them over\nMark Ruffalo-a charismatic nice guy in the group who gets along with everyone but disapproves of Bale\'s character\'s actions and has been warming up to his wife\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt-the youngest member of the group, but also very naive and hot-tempered\nAnthony Mackie-a cautious father figure/best friend type to Gordon-Levitt\'s character and an enforcer in the group\nScarlett Johansson-the girl of Renner\'s dreams; very attractive yet also charismatic and understanding; turns out to be working with the police as a double agent but feels bad since she fell for Renner\nMargot Robbie-a superficial beauty; so drawn in and obsessed with her looks that she turns away basically anyone that is attracted to her, putting herself on a pedestal and overcompensating for her rather hollow personality\nMila Kunis-Gordon-Levitt\'s friend and would be love interest; she\'s the voice of reason; he realizes how he really feels about her too late\nRebecca Hall-Bale\'s neglected and exhausted wife who turns to Ruffalo for help\nCameos: Will Smith as the police chief working with Scarlett; Martin Scorsese; Adam Sandler; Jerry Seinfeld; Jimmy Fallon; Gene Wilder; Robert De Niro; Mike Alstott; Evan Longoria; Chris Archer; Brooklyn Decker; Kate Upton; Bono; Ryan Tedder; Drake; Kendrick Lamar; Lupe Fiasco; John Legend\nMusic from: U2, OneRepublic, Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Lupe Fiasco, John Legend, Imagine Dragons, The Black Keys, X Ambassadors, Eminem, Coldplay, American Authors, Big Sean, Kid Ink, Jeremih, ScHoolboy Q, A$AP Rocky, J.Cole, Jay Z, Kanye West\nMusic composed by Hans Zimmer\n^Idk if it\'ll all work out like this, but that is my dream, a pretty damn big one for my first film.\nHAUNTED HOUSE PROJECT no title yet\nIn terms of this project, I just thought it would be really cool to make a comedy, first of all because they\'re probably the most entertaining and crowd-pleasing films to watch, if done right, and second of all because I just love the recent wave of comedies with the \'what if\' type of questions. For example, \'what if a bunch of prima donna actors were stuck in Vietnam with a bunch of drug lords in pursuit\'? There you have Tropic Thunder. \'What if some kid\'s teddy bear came to life, what would happen 20 years later\'? There you have Ted. \'What if a bunch of best friends got stuck in an apocalyptic scenario\'? There you have This is the End. The list goes on and on. I want to chip in and also, add some personal quirks to each character reflecting back on some of my friends and put them in this scenario: what if a group of friends were stuck inside a haunted house together? You\'ve seen this done many times in actual horror films, but this is different cuz this is through and through comedy with the same type of twists that some of the films aforementioned had. In terms of the cast, this is who I\'m thinking:\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt-the guy that gets everyone together; he\'s not the leader, but he\'s the one that everyone can get along with; sometimes gets caught in the wrong situation at the wrong time; gets down on himself a lot; charismatic, nice, and understanding\nScarlett Johansson-Gordon-Levitt\'s girlfriend that he\'s about to propose to that weekend; he\'s liked her for a long time, but he doesn\'t know how much he likes him in return because he thinks she\'s \'out of his league\' per se, but in reality she really does\nChris Pine-Gordon-Levitt\'s best friend; had a rough time earlier on in his life and has been toughened to the point where he knows how to deal with rough situations; charismatic and funny, but still trying to put some of the past demons away\nNatalie Portman-Pine\'s wife; he\'s liked her ever since he saw her and the same goes for her; she understands him and has been through similar situations\nSeth Rogen-a good friend to everyone in the group; very funny and sarcastic; unpredictable with some of the stuff he says; also sort of emotionally closed off to a degree and secretly a deep thinker\nMargot Robbie-Rogen\'s wife; she\'s funny and charismatic and gets along well with Rogen, also understanding him\nAnthony Mackie-lazy and a bit reserved but still charismatic and offhandedly funny\nEmma Stone-Mackie\'s wife; charismatic and reserved, but becomes increasingly more comfortable\nMichael B. Jordan-very charismatic and funny but also observant and understanding\nZoe Saldana-Jordan\'s girlfriend; understanding and observant\nBradley Cooper-the real leader of the group; outgoing and willing to take charge; funny but also reserved to a degree\nJennifer Lawrence-Cooper\'s wife; outgoing and easy to get along with\nChadwick Boseman-shy and lazy but easy to get along with and understanding\nMila Kunis-Boseman\'s girlfriend, who\'s trying to get him to come out of his shell\nJames Spader-the house\'s owner; creepy and menacing; the antagonist\nAndy Serkis-Spader\'s right hand man; very strange and mysterious\n\nWAR\nI wanted this film, if at all possible to sort of be a dream scape scenario and a basic satire of Hollywood and studio heads that throw millions of dollars into projects just for a pay check.\nThis film will be about a bunch of famous cinematic heroes going up against a bunch of famous cinematic villains, and metaphorically and sometimes literally, they are just wondering why this happened and where this will take them.\nHEROES\nCaptain America\nIron Man\nBatman\nHulk\nIndiana Jones\nJason Bourne\nFalcon\nVILLAINS\nBane\nUltron\nGeneral Grievous\nDarth Vader\nMichael Corleone\nThe Joker\nDISNEY PROJECTS\nI owe Disney a lot, I grew up watching the movies, and my family is really into all of that, and I have many younger siblings. The Disney movies are the first things that really drew me into loving movies and really fired up my passion and creativity, and I\'d love to do the same and give other people that same sort of experience. I also notice that there\'s several projects with a lot of untapped potential, and I\'d like to work with them. So, specifically speaking if I make it to where I want to be, here are a list of some of the projects I\'m interested in working on.\n\nMAGIC KINGDOM\nThis was said to be a film about a family visiting Walt Disney World in Florida and they stay a little past the time the title park closes. The park suddenly comes to life, with all the characters getting up and walking around, and they find themselves in the middle of it. I always found this idea very interesting, and one that I\'ve loved ever since I was a kid. Now, it was slated to be in development with Jon Favreau directing but he\'s working on several different things and I have no idea if it\'ll ever pan out, but I\'ve had a vision for this ever since I was a little kid.\n\nJUNGLE CRUISE\nThis is another project Disney had in development for awhile, and it was slated to star Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. Whatever the case, I don\'t know if that\'ll ever pan out. But I like the idea of a few people traveling on a cruise down the jungle, encountering different obstacles in order to find a cure for something. It just sounds a lot like the movies I grew up watching, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nSWISS FAMILY ROBINSON\nThe original was pretty good, but it\'s outdated by now, and due for a remake. I think this could be done very well. For those who don\'t know, this is a story of a shipwrecked family that make their home on an island while trying to figure out when they will ever leave or get help, and then pirates come into the equation.\n\nPIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN\nDon\'t get me wrong, I grew up watching the first three films the fourth was awful and even the third was not all that great either. I thought the first two were alright, but they never fully gave off the vibe that it needed, the one that was in the ride, and I think I can reboot the series, if given a chance, only bringing Jack Sparrow and Davy Jones back on board but wiping everything else clear.\n\nENCHANTED TIKI ROOM\nI always liked that tropical atmosphere, and this would be a great Polynesian type of animated film.\n\nSPLASH MOUNTAIN\nI always loved this ride and the story behind it and Song of the South was released in 1946, and it\'s about time to make a new animated film for this attraction.\n\nBIG THUNDER MOUNTAIN RAILROAD\nThe Western keeps trying to come back and we\'ve seen some pretty good ones over the past few years. This could be the film that The Lone Ranger wasn\'t. The backstory is about a city called Tumbleweed and a mountain full of gold, but the mountain is said to be cursed. A lot of potential here.\n\nHAUNTED MANSION\nOf course this was made into a film with Eddie Murphy starring, and it was pretty pitiful. Guillermo del Toro has been slated to direct a reboot but who knows whenever that\'ll come to fruition? I think this attraction deserves a proper film, one that\'s dark, but still has a sense of fun to it.\nSPACE MOUNTAIN\nAnother interesting sci-fi film in terms of humans getting stranded in space, but this could be a variation on that, and be a pretty good film.\n\nEPCOT\nA film that would be based on the park, and a basic lay out for where humans and life are headed in the future.\n\nJOURNEY INTO IMAGINATION WITH FIGMENT\nThis would be an animated film based on the title character, strictly because I always grew up thinking he deserved one, but was never given it.\n\nSOARIN\'\nI believe a film about a cross country tour on a glider, if done right, could be a thrilling experience and really fun to watch.\n\nTEST TRACK\nThis is another sci-fi film I would love to make, one where people obtain the technology to make their own vehicles and design exactly how they want them to be thinking outside the box and stuff.\n\nMISSION: SPACE\nYet another interesting sci-fi film possibility, about astronauts in training and which ones will make it and which ones don\'t.\n\nTHE MAELSTROM\nAn interesting fantasy based on the former attraction, rooted in Norwegian folklore about trolls and Vikings, and other such things.\n\nTHE GREAT MOVIE RIDE\nA variation on the Magic Kingdom idea as well as the War idea, where characters from films throughout cinematic history come to life.\n\nTHE TWILIGHT ZONE TOWER OF TERROR\nA film about a haunted tower/elevator, which would be pretty interesting as well.\n\nFANTASMIC!\nA twist on the Magic Kingdom idea, where Mickey\'s imagination becomes controlled by a few Disney villains and his nightmares start becoming reality. Could be a very interesting animated film, and one I\'ve thought about since I was younger.\n\nCOUNTDOWN TO EXTINCTION\nA time travel machine is obtained, and passengers are sent back to the time of the dinosaurs, however they are unknowingly sent right before extinction begins. Could be a great film.9Embed', 'default'",1

AHa___The_Swing_Of_Things_Album_Version,anger,"'Rap Critic Reviews: “Always On Time” by Ja Rule and Ashanti LyricsHi, I’m the Rap Critic. Let’s talk about Ja Rule. Yeah… remember him?\nWell, if you do, you, you’ll remember that he was one of the more successful 2Pac Knock-offs that tried to capatilize off of his likeness in the aftermath of his death, as made obvious by the bald head, red bandana, and perpetual shirtlessness, but whereas Tupac’s musical material, no matter how controversial or disagreeable, at least came across as genuine, intricate, insights of a man trying to sort out his world, Ja Rule’s music came across as very… watered down, to say the least\n\nFirst of all, he sang WAY too much for a hardcore thug, as he kept claiming to be. Secondly, he sang WAY too much for someone who CAN’T SING. *montage of Ja Rule singing* And Third, he had all of the mannerisms of 2Pac with absolutely none of the substance. And fourth, we already had a late 90’s, eastcoast version of 2Pac. His name was DMX!\n\nAnd this is a comparison that must be noted, because not only did DMX arrive on the scene about a year before Ja Rule, but he also had an energy, griminess, and passion in his rhymes that made Ja Rule look like a corny knock off. X had diversity in his topics, ranging from hardcore anthems to tracks about multiple personalities to songs detailing his life like “Slippin’”. His material was not only more clever and diverse, but also grittier, making you believe every word he viciously growled. That, coupled with the fact that, in 1998, both his first and second albums went number one in the same year, and you can bet your ass people were trying to imitate the formula. Not by trying to achieve the same intensity or ability as DMX, but by taking his exact aesthetic, and watering it down to hell\n\nNow, Ja and DMX were actually cool with each other at first, that is until right around the release of his second album, Rule 3:36, which is about the time Ja started going from run-of-the-mill gangsta rapper to employing one of the worst trends in HipHop: the “thugs need love too” songs. These were Ja Rule’s Bread and FREAKING butter: songs with females on the chorus singing soulfully about how much they need Ja Rule and declaring their loving loyalty to him while he, in return, spits rhymes about hardcore sex and how much of a gangsta and playa he still is, despite his relationship with her. By the end of 2002, there was a never-ending torrent of “I wanna be gangsta for the fellas and lovey-dovey for the ladies” songs that dominated the airwaves for a while, the biggest single of which was “Always On Time”, which is pretty much the first and last song from him that you really needed to hear when it comes to this topic. Everything that’s done right and wrong is on this song, and mostly, it’s done wrong, so let’s check it out\n\n""Always there when you call Buckshots, hah, always on time""\nRIGHT THERE! That’s exactly what I’m talking about. Smooth, R and B singer crooning about love for the girls, but we’ve still gotta be hardcore, so I gotta talk about shooting guns!... Despite the fact that that has nothing to do with the mood she’s trying to set. Like, in reality, this wouldn’t work\n\n*singing* Yeah, boy, You know I love you! Tell me what you say to that! *pause* *guns go off* Holy shit! What the fuck!\n\n“Gave you my.... baby be mine”\nWhat… what did you give him?\n“And I gave you my all, now baby be mine”\nOh… why was that edited out the first time? Did the first take have a… different word there?\n\n“Gave you my....” *...you know… “baby be mine”\n\nAlthough, the word she actually says here is “I gave you my all”, but then she says, “Now baby, be mine”. And, seeing that the context is, “Yeah, I don’t always answer my phone, but when you need me, I’m there, giving you my “ALL” and since, after giving him her “all”, she still doesn’t know whether or not he wants to be with her, I’m going to forgo any thought that she’s talking about spending quality time together as a loving couple and just assuming she’s talking about her… you know…\n\nBUT, it’s just innocuously worded enough that someone could interpret it in a more innocent context, and that’s a great way that R and B writing works: you can easily deduce a sexual or emotional context from what they’re saying. However, when the verses are coming from a rapper who’s still trying to be hardcore…\n\n“C\'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover\nYou know, the one that swing dick like no other”\n\nGoodbye, subtlety…\n\n""I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain\nBut baby you know the name and love is about pain""\n\nYeah, I know I’ve done very disrespectful things to you in the past, but, hey, you know who I am! I’m a rich rapper! And besides, love is SUPPOSED to be about being hurt. That’s why I’m doing things that hurt you! I’m ONLY trying to verify the enduring power of our love!\nYou might also like""So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints""\n\nYeah, so just sign these papers that will nullify your restraining order and… WHHA?!\n\n""Hold down on the bed while I\'m yankin your braids""\n\nI’m sorry, did you mention something about a restraining order a little while ago?\n\n""Thug style, you never thought I\'d make you smile""\n\nI guess not! She had a freaking restraining order on you! Look, I understand that people get into relationship problems, but if it’s come to the point of trying to legally restrict a person from being near you, we’ve tread into some dangerous territory\n\n""While I\'m smackin you fast and hittin you all wild""\n\nThat line about restraining orders is really ruining the rest of this song\n\n""[With Ashanti] But we share somethin so rare,""\n\nYes, most couples DON’T have what we have between us, namely a document stating that we can’t be within 100 feet of each other\n\n""But who cares?""\n\nThe court that drafted it?\n\n“Baby, I’m not always there when you call, but I’m always on time”\nAre you still singing this chorus? Why do you like this guy? He’s obviously not worth your time!\n\n“Girl, get a grip, c\'mon, pull it together”\n\nSee, even Ja Rule wants you to get over him! He’s done nothing to illustrate why he’s not a good person! Like he said, get a grip!\n\nIt\'s only a sunshower, we been through worse weather”\n\nOh wait, was he saying “pull it together” and “get a grip” because he wants her to overlook his shortcomings, because they’ve “been through worse”, as he says? My bad, I guess. I thought he was having a moment of clarity, realizing he was a horrible person and telling her to move on from him. But what a foolish presumption, because most of these songs are about how “girl, you know that I’m a bad boy, and you like the fact that I’m a bad boy, and we’re terrible for each other, but we just can’t stay away from each other, because we love the fact that we’re not supposed to be together *points finger in mouth* and blegh! You know, where Wale handled this topic with nuance and gave the proper weight to the subject, Ja Rule’s songs exploit that angle, and that’s what annoys me. The way this chorus is sung, it treats the topic with no gravity whatsoever, and tries to make the whole thing cute while Ja’s lyrics in the verses outline just how stupid it really is\n\n""Like the stormy nights you wrote a ""Dear Ja"" letter\nAnd took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather""\n\nOkay, here’s an instance where she did something pretty crappy to him, but I’m fairly sure that she did this in response to something HE did\n\n""Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B\nMoney Over Bitches""\n\nYou know, like casually referring to her as a bitch, or living by the phrase “M.O.B.”, which means that he values money and material items over bitches, a derogatory term that he just called her, as in “Why did you cut up my car? Don’t you remember? I value material items more than I value you! See, this is why things aren’t working out! You don’t understand me!""\n\n“I got two or three hoes for every V”\n\nOr, you could look at the fact that he sees no shame in telling you that he has other girls\n\n“And I keep \'em drugged up off that ecstasy”\n\nAnd he keeps them high off of drugs to incapacitate them… like a pimp or… wait, is this song about a pimp and his relationship with a prostitute? Yeah, dude, I think it is! I mean, listen to that chorus again!\n\n“I’m not always there when you call, but I’m always on time”\n\nThat’s something a prostitute would say to her pimp, “yeah daddy, I may not always answer my phone, but I’m always on time with my money!” Dear God, why didn’t I see it before!\n\n""Believe me, this pimp game is very religious""\n\nSeriously, why didn’t I notice this? This is basically a song about how a pimp makes a girl feel special so that she’ll sell her body for him, and Ashanti is the chick who’s going for it! I mean, if that ISN’T what this song is about, and Ja Rule writing a love song can be this easily misconstrued as a pimp-ho relationship, well, I guess that just shows how terrible he is at it\n\n""I play hard, there\'s so many women I fathered""\n\nWait, “fathering” someone means that you’ve been a father to a person. So, you’re bragging about the fact that you have a lot of daughters? I mean, contextually, this should be another line about how many women you’ve had sex with, but if you’re saying you “fathered” them, that verb specifically means to be a father to someone, so… unless raising multiple daughters was a thing that rappers bragged about in the early 2000’s, this line is very wrongly worded\n\n“Oh I\'m, feelin like ya livin a, double life\nCause you don\'t be comin home, sometimes”\n\nHold on, so now, Ja Rule is the one concerned about her faithfulness? You just told us that you have two hoes for every car you own. As far as we know, you’re the only one who’s had sex with anyone else, so excuse me if I don’t show sympathy to your speculations that probably arise from the fact that you’re afraid your girlfriend might have the exact same morality code as you!\n\nAnd you could say that this is a lust song, that’s it’s not meant to be taken as a song about intimate relationships as much as sexual attraction, but then what’s the excuse for cutesy lines like this:\n\n""But we share something so rare\nBut who cares, you care""\n\nDude, I know what this really is. This isn’t a morally elusive song for the purpose of telling us a real story about two people struggling between lust and genuine attraction, this is a morally elusive song for the purpose of fooling girls into thinking he has a softer side to make them believe he’ll treat them special, all the while flagging the “but I’m a complicated thug” card that’s supposed to make it okay for him to have sex with other women because he “just doesn’t want to be committed yet”!\n\nIt’s obvious, it’s manipulative, and it’s a perfect example of why I don’t like these songs when they’re done this way. And that’s not to say that I don’t like Rap love songs in general, or that hardcore rappers shouldn’t make love songs. It can be done right. Look at the quintessential “thugs need love too” song, “All I Need” by Method Man\n\n“Back when I was nothing You made a brother feel like he was somethin\nThat\'s why I\'m with you to this day boo no frontin\nEven when the skies were gray You would rub me on my back and say ""Baby it\'ll be okay""”\n\nThis is a great example of a rap love song that doesn’t come across as either corny or pandering\n\n""I\'m realizing that you didn\'t have to fuck wit me\nBut you did, now I\'m going all out kid And I got mad love to give,""\n\nSure, to some people, this may not sound super romantic and sweet, but this brand of HipHop isn’t about that: it’s raw, it’s reality, and it sounds authentic, and it doesn’t need to be sugar-coated, which is what they did for “Always On Time”, to cover up the fact that it’s not about love, it’s about manipulating women into thinking that Ja Rule gives a crap about you, and it barely bothers to hide it. Sorry, but I just hate the mood of this song. Ashanti here is desperately trying to get her to love him, begging him to be hers, and the only thing he does is talk about how awesome he is. It’s annoyingly lop-sided in regards to who’s giving them self to the other. I’d give this song a 1 out of 5, because, you know, Ashanti was an okay singer\n\nI’m the Rap Critic. You don’t have to like my opinion, but I don’t have to like your song!5Embed', 'default'",3

Arab_Strap___New_Birds,calm,"""New Birds LyricsYou just have to be sure you're doing the right thing. I mean it's very easy to forget - she was just sitting there in the pub with her new friends and her new life and her new hair, and it might have been five years but you'd know just to look at her\n\nI wasn't even sure it was her at first; I was ready to walk away but she smiled and called me over and we said hello for a bit. When we went back to our tables we were trying not to look over at each other and told our friends to stop staring. I didn't see her for the rest of the night, but by closing time the beer's kicked in so I go up and speak to her and we end up going for a walk, and talking about our new homes, our new jobs, our new friends, and our new birds\n\nShe said she'd been going out with him now for about two and a half years, but they don't live together so he'd never find out. And you think about chasing her about school when you were wee and lying in your bed and listening to love songs and pretending they were about you. And the first time you asked her out she said no but one night you went to a wedding and when you came back to the pub she'd changed her mind and you went out. You remember the way she swung her arms when she held your hand but you can't remember how she kissed and now you've got the chance to find out\n\nBut you have to remember there's this other kiss and she's sittin' at home wondering where you are and what you're doing. And you worked hard on this kiss and you know it inside out; it's as much yours as it is hers, and it took a long time to get right, it took months of practice and months of embarrassment, but now you've got it perfected and you've been looking forward to that kiss all week\nYou can see her breath in the air between your faces, as you stand in the leaves and she just asks you straight out if you want to come and stay at her flat. But you make sure you get separate taxis and you go home and there might be a slight regret and maybe you'll wonder what you missed, but you have to remember the kiss that you worked so hard on.

Arab_Strap___The_First_Big_Weekend,calm,"'The First Big Weekend LyricsSo that was the first big weekend of the summer...\nStarts Thursday as usual with The Canteen quiz and again no-one wins the big cash prize\nLater I do my sound bloke routine by approaching Gina\'s new boyfriend to say that he shouldn\'t feel that there\'s any animosity between us and then I even go and make peace with her: shouldn\'t have bothered\n\nThen on Friday night we went through to the Arches...\n\nThere was only one car going so some of us had to get the train. We got through quite late. Then we went to a pub to take the gear\nThere was no problems getting in - we saw some others waiting down the front of the queue so we skipped in\nIt was a good night - everyone was nutted and I ended up dancing with some blonde girl\nI thought she had been quite pretty until last night when Matthew informed me that she had, in fact, been a pig\nWhen the club finished we wandered the streets for a while until we got to this 24-hour cafe\nI didn\'t like the look of it so we left and got a taxi back to Morag\'s flat\nI couldn\'t sleep so I sat about drinking someone else\'s strawberry tonic wine and tried to keep everyone else up\n\nThen at ten o\'clock in the morning we went downstairs to buy some drink\nWe had intended to watch the football in the afternoon but we\'d passed out by then and slept right through it, awaking to find that England had won two-nil\nThen we went to get the train home and had a few in the station bar\nWe had some stuff left from the previous night\'s supplies so when we got home we decided to go down to John\'s indie disco\nSame story as Friday - lots of hugging, lots of dancing etc. etc\nI couldn\'t sleep again so went to the park to look at the toon, taking a detour through the playpark\nTo get in we had to climb over a ten-foot steel fence, which resulted in severe bruising of our hands, legs and groins, but we had a good laugh on the stuff, especially the tube-slide, which probably doubles up as a urinal for drunk teens\nThen we walked through the woods to have a look at the tomb. Big disappointment, but the mist on the lake was cool\nSunday afternoon we go up to John\'s with a lot of beer in time to watch The Simpsons - it was a really good episode about love always ending in tragedy except, of course, for Marge and Homer. It was quite moving at the end and to tell you the truth my eyes were a bit damp\n\nThen we watched these young girls in swimsuits have a water fight in the street You taping this, aye?\nWe went up to the pub about ten\nIt was busy for a Sunday night, lots of people we know, including my first ever girlfriend who I still find very attractive, quite frankly, but I didn\'t really speak to her\nShe\'s probably still a bitch, anyway\nHer friend Gillian was there, I had a chat with her, she was still quite pleasant\nAt the same time I watched Malcolm make some terrible attempt to try and chat up a girl we know called Jo. He made some remark about her skirt that was barely there the previous night or something\n\nI couldn\'t sleep again that night, thanks to some seriously disturbing nightmares...Matthew says I should cut down on the cheese\n\n""went out for the weekend, it lasted for ever, high with our friends it\'s officially summer.""\n""went out for the weekend, it lasted for ever, high with our friends it\'s officially summer.""\n""went out for the weekend, it lasted for ever, high with our friends it\'s officially summer.""\n""went out for the weekend, it lasted for ever, high with our friends it\'s officially summer.""\n""went out for the weekend, it lasted for ever, high with our friends it\'s officially summer.""\nYou might also likeI got some sleep eventually on Monday afternoon\nIt was a beautiful day, and later that evening Malcolm introduced me to the power of Merrydown - £1.79 a litre, 8.2% - mmmm.....\n\nJudith and Laura came round later and we sat in my back garden and drank\nThen Matthew came round and we went up the town\n\n""went out for the weekend, it lasted for ever, high with our friends yeah""\n\nIt\'s officially summer\n\n""went out for the weekend, it lasted for ever, high with our friends it\'s officially summer.""1Embed', 'default'",2

Bright_Eyes___When_The_President_Talks_To_God_Single_Version,anger,"'Walt Whitman An American LyricsHis rooms in Camden were shin-deep in wadded paper; nonchalance was one of the household gods. Visitors, wading in, knew the others so numinously there around the old man with so much white hair and beard, so freckled and so barbarically slouched on a buffalo robe: the ghosts of Rossini and Scott, of Lincoln and Columbus, of Ancharsis Cloots and Elias Hicks, and two supreme goddesses, Artemis Philomeirix and Eleutheria who eidolon was erected in his sixty-third year on Bedloe’s Island, a gift from the French, three hundred and two feet tall, status and pediment together, the word of Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi, at the sight of which millions of eyes would water in gray dawns with an anguish of hope which only Whitman’s poetry can duplicate “Not a grave of the murdered for freedom but grows seed for freedom…in its turn to bear seed, Which the winds carry far and re-sow, and the rains and the snows nourish”, Liberty.\nLincoln, on horseback, tipped his hat to him in Washington one day, a gazing stranger whom Lincoln must have supposed was some office seeker or underling in one of the departments, perhaps a geologist with that grizzled a beard. It was the Republican equivalent of Napoleon looking in on Goethe to talk history and poetry.\nHe attended Poe’s funeral, standing toward the back of the mourners. He comforted the dying in the war like Henry James and wrote letters home for them like Ezra Pound at Pisa.  Not until he was an old man did anyone care or know who he was. George Collins Cox came and photographed him hugging children and copyrighted the photograph, as if Walt were Niagara Falls or Grand Grand Canyon; Thomas Eakins came and did a masterpiece of a portrait. Young men came and learned what they might do with their lives, John Burroughs being the star pupil.\n\nLike Poe, he has always been suspect in his own country. To name the Walt Whitman Bridge the authorities had to sidestep the objections of Christians and Patriots that his morals were un-American. Emerson, who once strolled through the louvre without stopping in front of a single picture, was at pains to have it known that he was not a close friend of Whitman’s. Thoreau wrote in his journal, December 1, 1856: “As for the sensuality in Whitman’s ‘Leaves of Grass,’ I do not so much wish that it was not written, as that men and women were so pure that they could read it without harm.”\n\n“Whitman,” Kafka told his friend Gustav Janouch, “belongs among the greatest formal innovators in the modern lyric. One can regard his unrhymed verse as the progenitor of the free rhythms of Arno Hols, Émile Verhaeren, and Paul Claudel…the formal element in Walt Whitman’s poetry found an enormous echo throughout the world. Yet Walt Whitman’s significance lies elsewhere. He combined the contemplation of nature and of civilization, which are apparently entirely contradictory, into a single intoxicating vision of life, because he always had sight of the transitoriness of all phenomena. He said: ‘Life is the little thing that is left over from dying.’ So he gave his whole heart to every leaf of grass. I admire in him the reconciliation of art and nature….He was really a Christian and—with a close affinity especially to us Jews—he was therefore an important measure of the status and worth of humanity.”* [FOOTNOTE *Gustav Janouch, Conversations with Kafka, translated by Goronwy Rees, New Directions, 1971, p. 167.]\n\n“Have you read the American poems by Whitman?” Van Gogh wrote to his sister-in-law in September 1888. “I am sure Theo has them, and I strongly advise you to read them, because to begin with they are very fine, and the English speak about them a good deal. He sees in the future, and even in the present, a world of healthy, carnal love, strong and frank—of friendship—of work—under the great starlit vault of heaven a something which after all one can only call God—and eternity in its place above this world. At first it makes you smile, it is all so candid and pure; but it sets you thinking for the same reason.\n“The ‘Prayer of Columbus’ is very beautiful.”** [FOOTNOTE ** Complete Letters of Vincent Van Gogh, Vol. III, New York Graphic Society, 1958, p. 445.]\n\nThe range of sensibilities that responded to his is impressive and a bit puzzling: Henry James, Melville, Swinbure, Tennyson, Victor Hugo, John Hay, Yeats, the Rossettis. He was a force useful to talents as diverse as those of William Carlos Williams and Dino Campana, Guillaume Apollinaire and Hart Crane. He had freed poetry from exclusive commitments to narrative and the ode. He closed the widening distance between poet and audience. He talks to us face to face, so that our choice is between listening and turning away. And in turning away there is the uneasy feeling that we are turning our backs on the very stars and on ourselves.\n\nHe succeeded in making himself a symbol of American idealism as bright as and in many ways far more articulate than Jefferson or Jackson. But as an ideal figure he turned out to be risky currency. Thoreau and Emerson were safer, more respectable, and more apt to remain in the realm of ideas.\n\nWhitman, Jack Yeats complained, was bad for the American spirit because it seemed to him that we indulged all too naturally in that in which Whitman urged us to wallow. Beerbohm caricatured this view of Whitman “…inciting the American eagle to soar”, and the young Ezra Pound in his pre-Raphaelite suit thought Whitman much too much, while intelligently suspecting that there was something there that the critics weren’t seeing.\n\nThere are lots of things the critics haven’t seen. It is for instance worthwhile reading Whitman against the intellectual background he assumed his readers knew and which is no longer remembered except sporadically: the world of Alexander von Humboldt from which Whitman takes the word cosmos; Louis Agassiz, for whom Thoreau collected turtles; Volney’s Ruins, the historical perspective of which is as informative in Whitman as in Shelley; Fourier; Scott. A great deal that seems naïve and spontaneous in Whitman has roots and branches.\n\nHis age still read Plutarch as part of its education, and Whitman’s understanding of erotic camaraderie looks different less personal and eccentric beside a knowledge of the Theban Sacred Band under Pelopidas and Epameinondas, whose conversations in Elysium with Freud one would like to hear, those heroes who names were terror to the Spartan infantry, who were Pythagoreans who believed, in the Master’s dictum, that a friend is another self, who were sworn to chastity, and who passed daily the palace of an old king named Oedipus.\n\nAnd they were, as they said in their language, democrats.\n\nWhitman’s fond gaze was for grace that is unaware of itself; his constant pointing to beauty in common robust people was a discovery. Custom said that beauty was elsewhere. Women in his time were pathologically interested in their own looks, especially in well-to-do families, because that would be their sole achievement, aside from motherhood, on this earth. There were laced breathlessly into corsets, caged in hoop-skirts, harnessed into bustles. Their bodies were girl about with bodices, drawers, bloomers, stockings, gloves, petticoats. Their shoes were always too small. They took no more exercise than aged invalids. Their hair was curled with irons heated in an open fire, then oiled, then shoved into a bonnet it would tire a horse to wear. Their flesh never met the light of the sun. They fainted frequently and understandably. How in the world did they pee?\n\nIn Plutarch you could read about Spartan girls who wrestled with boys, both naked. It was the opinion of the Spartans that clothing on would be indecent. We know of a Philadelphia woman in the time of Dr. Benjamin Rush who chose to die in modesty rather than let a doctor see her breasts.\n\nOn suspects that Theoreau would have married a woodchuck or a raccoon, in the biology of the union could have been arranged. Whitman might, given the opportunity, like Clarence King or Lafcadio Hearn, have married a black woman. It was one of his fantasies that he had had one for a mistress.\n\nFreud’s replacing one Calvinism with another pretty much the same should not fool us into thinking we can say that Whitman’s love for handsome boys was a psychosis which we can then subtract from his book, like Victoria looking at da Vinci’s notebooks with the anatomical drawings decorously covered by brown paper. That love is the very heart of his vision. He was re-inventing a social bond that had been in civilization from the beginning, that had, in Christian Europe, learned various dodges, \\and met its doom in Puritanism and was thus not in the cultural package unloaded on Plymoth Rock.\n\nAs in the ancient world Whitman had no patience with the pathic as his word was, the effeminate. He wanted in men and women a love that was unaware of itself, as heroism is unaware of itself, as children are unaware of their own beauty. What Whitman was observing as the mating habits of the species was a debased form of Courtly Love that the industrial revolution had entwined with commerce a pretty wife was an asset to a rich man, indeed, she was part of his wealth. Women were caught in a strange new myth, as if Pluto were the most eligible husband for Persephone.\n\nThere was accuracy in Whitman’s turning to those spirits that were free to be lively, lusty, inventive. He loved as Nietzsche said of the Greeks, the health of the race. His race was like none before. It stood at a unique place in history. It joined the two halves of the world. Whitman’s great vision culminated in his celebration of the spanning of our continent with rails, the closing of the gap between Europe and America with the transatlantic cable, and the opening of the Suez Canal. These completed the circle Columbus had drawn the first brace arc of. More than commerce would flow along that new route that at last belted the whole earth. Why should not ideas as archaic as man himself immigrate along that line?\nOne reason Whitman is so interested right now is that we do not yet know if that band around the earth is an umbilicus or a strangling cord. Albert Speer explained at Nuremberg that radio and telephone had amplified Hitler’s scope and accelerated the implementation of his orders so far beyond any power available to previous tyrants that we need a new kind of imagination to grasp how so much evil could have been done in those twelve infernal years. The first hell allowed by the world belt was Whitman’s own Civil War, an old feud of the English that infected the new world and broke out with renewed vigor, Roundhead and Cavalier, North and South, industrialist and planter.\n\nWhitman’s fellow nurse in the Union hospitals, Henry James, would live until 1916, another hell caused by easy scope of movement. Modernity seems to sink Whitman’s vision of a cohesive society further and further back into the past while isolating its essential purity and brilliance. The final sterilizer of his vision would seem to be the internal combustion engine, which has made all movement restless and capricious.\n\nAnd at the center of all Whitman’s poetry there is movement. His age walked with a sprier step than ours; it bounced in buckboard and carriage; a man on a horse has his blood shaken and his muscles pulled. A man in an automobile is as active as a sloth; an airplane ride offers no activity more strenuous than turning the pages of a magazine. Dullness, constant numbing dullness, was the last thing Whitman would have thought of America, but that is what has happened.\n\nIn his second letter to Emerson Whitman objected at length to “writers fraudulently assuming as always dead what everyone knows to be always alive. He meant sex; I wonder if the assumption might not now be valid of the mind. From Whitman onward there is a distrust of the poet in the United States. The art of genteel America was to be fiction, the movies, and Schlagsahne. There is a bewildering irony in New England Transcendentalism’s fathering both Whitman and the current notion that poetry is cultural icing, spiritual uplift, wholly unrelated to anything at all. What was useful to middle-class frumpery was trivialized for anthologies, and the rest dismissed to the attention of professors and idealists.\n\nWithin a few miles of each other in the 1880s Whitman was putting last touches to his great book, Eadweard Muybridge was movements milliseconds apart of thousands of animals, naked athletes, and women, and Thomas Eakins was painting surgeons, boxers, musicians, wrestlers, and Philadelphians. Mary Cassatt, who might have been among them, had moved to France, Permanently. In a sense Muybridge and Eakins were catching up with Whitman’s pioneering. Their common subject, motion, the robust real, skilled and purposeful action, was distinctly American, an invention. Eakins and Muybridge were forgotten for years; Eakins came over to Camden and photographed and painted Whitman. Their arts ran parallel, shared a spirit and a theme.  Muybridge’s photographs, the monumental Zoopraxis, kept Degas and Messonier up all night looking at it. There has been no finer movement in American art, nor a more fertile one from Muybridge, through Edison, the whole art of the film, and yet their impact was generally felt to be offensive. Eakins and Muybridge were forgotten for years; Whitman persisted.* [FOOTNOTE *Muybridge inscribed the double-folio Zoopraxis: Men and Animals in Motion as a gift to Haverford College, eccentric soul that he was. The good Quakers wrapped it in brown paper and hid it on the shelves of the library among outsized books, omitting to list it in the card catalogue. I found the bulky parcels there in an idle moment in 1964. Once I saw what I’d found, I commanded three hale students to help me carry it to my apartment, I then called the great kinesiologist Ray L. Birdwhistell, Jr., who dropped everything and came out. We spread the sheets all over the floor and in hours of looking I listened to Birdwhistell’s analysis of how nineteen-century people moved, what they did with shoiulders, elbows, hips, eyebrows, toes, knees. Sherlock Holmes would have fallen down and worshiped. Any reading of Whitman is vastly enriched by a knowledge of Eakins and Muybridge; their arts can now be seen as a complementary. Whether the Quakers have catalogued their Muybridge, sold it for the thousands of dollars it is worth, or put it back in its plain brown paper on the back shelves of the library I have never asked. ]\n\nGrass: “a uniform hieroglyphic.” Meaning in Leaves of Grass is an interpretation of symbols. The poet’s work encompasses the undertaking of the most primitive transcriptions of nature into signs as well as contemporary decipherings of science, which had “great saurians” to explain, electricity, new planets. The double continuum of time and space became in Whitman’s imagination a coherent symbol of perspectives to range.\n\nEmerson’s “He seems a Minotaur of a man” and Thoreau’s “He occasionally suggests something a little more than human both remarks were in letters to friends, not public print catch Whitman in what would become traditional opinions: that his idealism was inappropriate to his rough matter, and that the roughness of his matter offended the idealism of his cultivated readers. No woman, it was assumed, could ever read him; Lowell insisted that the book, if placed in libraries, be kept from seminarians.\n\nIs he so big that no one has yet taken his size? The cooperative struggle to measure Melville revealed greatness upon greatness. Where Whitman’s tone is rich we can see his mastery: there is nothing anywhere like “Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking” Hugo at his most resonant and symbolic sounds thin beside it; Leopardi, a plausible rival, could not have achieved the wildness, the lonely openness of the poem. Nor does “When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom’d,” for all its Tennysonian color and voice, have an equal.\n\nThere are 390 poems in Leaves of Grass as Whitman left it. Modern editions add 42 others that he had rejected or not yet included; the Blodgett and Bradley Comprehensive Reader’s Edition Norton, 1965 adds 123 more pages of fragments, deletions, and notebook drafts.\n\nHe threw away:I am that halfgrown angry boy, fallen asleep,\n\nThe tears of foolish passion yet undried on my cheeks\n\nand\n\nHim of The Lands, identical, I sing, along the single thread…in which the full timbre of his voice is undiminished. Had Whitman written entirely in his strong, aria-like, lyric mode, he would have fared far better with the critics who speak of his formlessness and fellow poets who complain of the catalogues, the dross, the talk, but he would have been little more than an American Victorian, Tennyson with a twang.\nWe have paid too little attention to Whitman’s subjects, especially when they smack of the prosaic. Consider “Outlines for a Tomb” G. P. buried 1870,” which imagines various tableaux for a millionaire philanthropist’s tomb, a poem thoroughly traditional, a classical eulogy to which Chaucerian pictured rooms have been added. The poem comes into stereoptic focus when we go to the trouble to discover that G. P. is George Peabody 17955–1869. The curious “buried 1870” becomes clear when we know that Peabody died in London and was brought home in a British war ship, with full honors. An apprentice to a dry-goods firm at eleven, he worked his way up in the world until, as head of a banking firm with offices in Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and London, he was able to become one of the first great merchant philanthropists. He gfave two million to the English for housing for the poor, a museum to Harvard, and a museum to Yale. Yale got her museum to house the paleontological collection of Othniel Marsh, who was Peabody’’s nephew; Harvard got hers to house Agassiz’s biological specimens. Havard was not originally a beneficiary; it was only after the pious Peabody discovered that Marsh was a Darwinian that he tried to counteract this heresy by bestowing equal funds on Harvard, where Agassiz, Darwin’s superior as a zoologist, declined to accept the great theory without further proof. Yet you will not find George Peabody in the Britannica*. [FOOTNOTE *You will in The Columbia Encyclopedia. For an account of Peabody in his scientific context, as well as for a splendid history of paleontology in the age of Whitman, see Robert West Howard’s The Dawnseekers, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1975. You can also see in this book a photograph of Edgar Allan Poe inspecting the fossil skeleton of a prehistoric horse: a discovery still unknown to Poe scholars. ]\n\nAs Whitman’s world faded into a dimness, a great deal of his poetry was rendered meaningless except as a general of abstract statement. Things vivid to him and his readers, such as Transcendentalism, the philosophy of Fourier and Owen, the discovery of dinosaurs in the west by Cope and Marsh, phrenology, photography, telegraphy, railroads, have fused into a blur. A technological era was beginning to articulate itself and Whitman was its poet. It was not a time to which one inside it could easily give a name, or a direction. Whitman’s only certainty was that he was living in a new kind of society, that tore itself asunder in the tragedy of the Civil War, but did not thereby abandon its original intention to be a democratic republic.Quicksand years that whirl me I know not whither.\n\nYour schemes, politics, fail, lines give way, substances mock and elude me,\n\nOnly the theme I sing…The theme. A music of sensations, songs containing catalogues of things, as if creation could be summoned and praised by chanting the name of everything there is, the constructing of a context, like Noah’s ark, where there is a place for everything, a compulsion to confront every experience with innocent eyes—no one phrase is ever going to label Whitman’s theme. The base on which it stands is Christian: a sympathy whose scope is rigorously universal, a predisposition to love and understand. Young admirers fancied him an American Socrates, but of course he is the very opposite. He was like those Greeks in love with the immediate, the caressable always with the eye, the delicious, who, to St. Paul’s distress, worshiped each other when free from placating and begging from a confusion of gods.\n\nAnd he was decidedly pagan, always ready with a good word for “the rhythmic myths of Greece and the strong legends of Rome.” A pagan is not a godless man; he is a man with many gods., Whitman could easily as he liked to imagine kneel with the Muslim, hear the Law with the Jew, sit in silence with the Quaker, dance with the Pawnee.\n\nThis splendid sympathy with forms knits his book together. Grass is the one universal plant, absent only in the deserts of the poles. Classifying and naming the grasses of the world has kept botanists overworked since Linnaeus, and the end is nowhere in sight. Leaves: we use the word for the pages of books, and the first paper was leaves of grass, papyrus. Grass is a symbol for life through the Bible, integral with the metaphor of shepherd and sheep.\n\nThere were “nations ten thousand years before these States”; we are carrying something on. And of this past “not a mark, not a record remains—and yet all remains.” From the people in the deep forgotten past,Some with oval countenances learn’d and calm,\n\nSome naked and savage, some like huge collections of insects,\n\n\nOur heritage is unknown but there is no doubt of there being a heritage.Chrales Fourier, who thought civilization a mistake, said that mans first duty is to keep the Sacred Flame, which he understood to be both our kinship to God and those livelinesses of spirit man himself had invented—the dance, poetry, music, mathematics, communal genius like French cuisine, Cretan stubbornness, Scotch skepticism, Dutch housekeeping,. Whitman knew Fourier only in the washed and bowdlerized versions of hi thought discussed at Brook Farm, and in the writings of Blaine, Greeley, and Margaret Fuller. Perhaps he believed Emerson’s warning that Fourier was basically unsound. Yet Whitman and Fourier were of the same historical moment, and much of their thought rhymes, though with many a dissonance. Fourier died in Montmarte, while saying his prayers, kneeling against his bed, surrounded by his cats when Whitman was 18. In those eighteen years Fourier was writing texts that would have interested Whitman immensely—they were not published until 1957, and some are still unpublished. They describe a world, the New Harmony as Fourier called it, that has kept the flame. It is a world divided up into beehives of communities, each of which is a family of human beings and animals. All work is done by everybody, an hour at a time. The days are rhythmic and contain a little of everything good. All sexual predilections are arranged for and honored for their diversity. Ceremonial honors are given to those whose passionate nation encompasses the widest range. All are friend and servant to all. Children learn every skill by age 10, yet the dominant note of the community is play.\n\nFourier’s vision was an opposite to the commercial world in which he lived and suffered. In utopian design his is the most extreme yet achieved. It can be explained by noting that Fourier’s every detail intends to save the individual from that dullness and quiet despair which was the immediate and alarming result of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nIf the world was to belong to the rapacious, civilization was then little more than the jungle. Rapacity, in any case, as Fourier thought, was alternative action symbolizing and disguising warmer passions unacceptable to civilization. Marriage, for instance, is a reproductive not a social unit. A true family is an enormous gathering of people, and where everybody knows where he belongs. The city was to disappear, and we may already have cause, watching the cities rot and revert to the jungle, to wonder whether Fourier’s small communities could possibly by this time have rotted with such Spenglerian gangrene as Detroit and St Louis.\n\nTo keep the sacred flame. The image is taken from antiquity, when the household fire was a god, part of which was give to each member of the family as they went away to new homes. Symbolically this fire was the family spirit, guardian of its integrity and survival. Fourier talks about it as if it were spirit itself, and he designed his Harmony to preserve the liveliness of the child into old age; he saw no reason why it should drain away. He is the only philosopher interested in happiness as the supreme human achievement. A good nature should be the whole concern of government. ‘\n\nIt was compliant, insouciant, easy good nature that Whitman admired most in a society. And nineteenth-century industrial culture had begun to erase the possibilities of Whitmanian good nature. Ruskin noted the characteristic sulk on America girls’ faces, the pout, the petulance. Look at the Steichen photograph of J. P. Morgan 1903, the one with the dagger. Slow-burning rage, not charming insouciance, was to be the standard American state of mind,.\n\nAn American publisher remembered in old age “a large-boned old man in a sombrero” shuffling into the Hotel Albert the anecdote is Ford Madox Ford’s, and is therefore suspect. “I am Walt Whitman,” said the old man, “if you’ll lend me a dollar you’ll be helping immortality to stumble on.” The dollar would have been equally useful upstairs in the hotel, where Rhyder hovered over his visions: American culture has the eerie habit of passing itself, in narrow corridors, ghostlike. Whitman’s personal loneliness and destitution became a part of the legend quite early. “A fine old fellow in an iron land” begins Rubén Darío’s sonnet to Whitman. Garcia Lorca:Not for a single moment, handsome old Walt Whitman,\nhave I lost the vision of your beard full of butterflies,\nyour corduroy shoulders wasted by the moon\nyour thighs of virginal Apollo,\nyour voice like a column of coarse ashes;\nold man beautiful as mist*\n\n[FOOTNOTE: *Geoffrey Dutton’s translation, in his Whitman, Grove Press, 1961, p. 111.]Crane in The Bridge lets his evocation of Whitman walking on the beach “Near Paumanok—your lone patrol…” blend with another beach, Kitty Hawk. Even if the Gasoline Age had not changed the world into the Slope of Sisyphus, it would still be arguable if any society could have lived up to Whitman’s idealism. Like Thoreau’s, it is an idealism for individuals rather than conglomerates. For all its acceptance of the city crowds and the bustle of commerce, it is in essence pastoral, following natural rhythms, with sympathies that depend on the broad and easy freedom of country people. Never again could a major American poet comprehend, much less repeat, Whitman;s vision. Yet many began there and were nourished on its honey before they ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Charles Ives did, set some of the poems as songs, but abandoned his Walt Whimtan Overture, if he ever indeed began it. Pound’s Cantos are a version of “A Passage to India” written in finer historical detail and transposed into a tragic mode. Paterson is Whitman;s vision after a devastating rain of acid vulgarity. Olson’s Maximus records the awful fact that Whitman’s prophecy for a coherent democratic society remains unfulfilled in nay sense, as we now live in an incoherent industrial society that has discovered that death is much better for business than life. The largest American business it he automobile, the mechanical cockroach that has eaten our cities; that and armaments.\n\nOf the delights celebrated in “A Song of Joys,” most are accessible now only to the very rich, some are obsolete, some are so exploited by commerce as to be no longer joys for anybody except the stockbroker, two are against the law swimming naked, sleeping with “grown and part-grown boys”, and one is lethal “the solitary walk”.\n\nWhitman is a kind of litmus paper, perhaps a seismograph. Reading him, we become aware of an awful, lost innocence, and are not certain whether the innocence was real or in Whitman’s imagination. He gave his whole life to a book, he freed literature to go courses that were until Whitman unsuspected. He had the power to move even unwilling hearts witness Gerard Manley Hopkins reading him because he couldn’t not read him, knowing the author to be “a scoundrel” and the poetry to be wicked. Pound in the cage at Pisa remembered a University of Pennsylvania philologist who was surprised at attitudes toward Whitman, as “even the peasants in Denmark know him.” The Japanese publish a journal devoted to him. The Russian Futurists and Mayakovsky considered Whitman to be the founder of their school.\n\nMany excellent books have been written about him, his place in world literature is still assured. He is still, however, a renegade, disreputable still. That he was a master of words and rhythms is affirmed and denied with equal passion. His cults come and go, He is, like Goethe in Germany and Victor Hugo in France, inextricably part of our history. Like Jefferson and Franklin he has been woven into our myth. He is our archetypal poet, our great invention in literature, our lyric voice., I like to think that eventually he will shame us into becoming Americans again.4Embed', 'default'",3

Big_Daddy_Weave___Words_Of_Life_Album_Version,anger,"'Magnificent [Author’s Notes & Thank You’s] LyricsThank you.\nThank you, thank you, thank you...\n\n\n\nI don\'t know what to say other than that. This whole project, whether you look at it as a mixtape or an album—to me—it\'s the beginning of my life\'s work. Literally. Some of the first few rhymes and personal musical compositions I ever wrote is on this very project. Stuff on here dates back to random scribbles on random class journal pages and napkins from my life in just 8th grade.\n\n\n\n- ""Kool-Aid and Frozen Pizza"" and ""What\'s the 411/The Ride"" were my first two raps of 2012.\n- ""I Have to Go"", ""Why You Forcing Me"" and ""I\'m Alive Again"" were among my first few original music and lyric compositions of that same year.\n\n\n\nAnd in just that year alone, I frequently was \'creating\'. Everyday before I had a laptop or a phone I basically had notebooks and pads on pads of new material and out of that—you actually have finally gotten the chance to hear a great amount of it. I\'ve been waiting a long time for that. For this. Honest. And that applies to every song on here. From the simple things I began drafting my freshman year at LaGuardia ""So Mellow"", ""I. A Whole New World"", to the more complex ideas branching from my complicated and isolated sophomore year ""Two Truths and a Lie"", ""Oncheezied"", this project for me is truly Magnificent, not just in content, but as an accomplishment, in all aspects of the word.\n\n\n\n...but this is surreal...\n\n\n\nFor some people it might be something of vanity that makes them continue in this field, or it bringing in the money that keeps them afloat, or for others it may just be the simplicity that it sometimes brings to your life. Specifically for me, I think it\'s the beauty of something I created actually coming to life. Except this time, it\'s not leading to the Pygmalion fault, it\'s leading to happiness. Sitting here listening to this stuff and playing it back, it\'s actually starting to sound the way I imagined it not so many years ago. That\'s inconceivable magic to me. Lovely magic. The type of magic that makes my grandparents smile at finally hearing their only son singing and loving music the way he used to—and it\'s that same smile that brightens their lives as they see their grandson doing what he\'s always wanted. The type of magic that makes me not feel alone but connected to more positive and beautiful things in life, more beautiful people. The type of magic that makes it clear anything is possible, even if it isn\'t necessarily obvious or evident. But, it\'s bittersweet just the same because this isn\'t it. It\'s not the end. I\'d like to be able to sit on this for a while and just listen with you. It\'s changed me, just in the way I hope it changes you. But I can\'t, I have to keep working. There\'s so much more I have to finish now that I don\'t think—but I know is possible.\n\nSo I\'d like to start by saying this is not your average mixtape. This is my mixtape. This is something different. Nothing on here is really going to sound like it\'s being DJ\'d and that\'s not the point if it were. It\'s the fact that despite what my father, Kedar and Mike have all told me throughout this phase of my life and how I ever felt about it—they\'re starting to sound right. This isn\'t a mixtape.\n\n\n\n...it\'s more of an album...\n\n\n\nA conceptual one on the objects and objectives of my desires, the inner workings of my puerile mind—that ironically refuses to be subject to mediocracy. And to those reading this, to those who I\'ve let in—especially those who I\'ve truly collaborated with on and during the time of recording this tape—I preach the same exact thing to you. To even those who don\'t enjoy this work of mine or aren\'t reading this, are reading this but don\'t feel it or perhaps may never read it, I still say the same. For the most part, I don\'t necessarily mind if you do not enjoy this. But I know I did and for now, I\'ll try my best to make that suffice and convince you I\'m worthy of your hearts next time around.\n\n\nNow for the thank you\'s...\n\nJharrel Jerome you\'re first up. From the bottom of my heart, thank you so very much for the opportunity that you gave me in the first place. ""Big Spender"", ""Rap Battle Skit 1"",  but then again all of F.M.L opened doors for me. Not only did you show me that literally someone my age could figure out a way to get a real studio and scrummage together some sort of money to get through an entire year of recording a project—but you gave me the template of what I believe helped me format this tape. And it was a template I had to both look up to and defeat at the same time. You making that both difficult and enjoyable for me has made me respect you more than just as an artist or as one of the many profusely heartwarming and talented creatures that walk this Earth, but as a man, and I will always look to you as that and nothing less. You\'re going to be an undoubtedly favorited addition to this label. All the best wishes to you and your family, as well as to your great success at Ithaca.\n\n\n\nTo the members of True Artists. I\'ll hit you all one by one in a moment, but I\'d like to start by saying you were the first part of the Magnificent family and my LaGuardia family. And I will never forget any of you for that. We\'ve kept each other intact in more ways than I bet any of us realize. We\'re changing the game with the stuff we do—and we know that. It\'s really too late to try and stray from it even if you wanted to. If anything happened to any of ya\'ll, I\'d lose it and I\'m glad we\'ve all stayed healthy and proud regardless of any of the traumas or stress in our lives. That\'s never negatively affected our art—but in some ways it\'s empowered it. Thus, why we\'re ""true artists"". I know we hated the name starting out, but I\'m glad it\'s grown on us. I\'ll always have your backs when something ever goes askew and you can count on me to be the one dumping the gatorade on each of you when we reach the end of the road.\n\nLet\'s start with you Vito—mister Travis Raeburn. I\'ve known you since middle school well, more like known of you then and officially gotten to know you and consider you a close friend of mine during our years at LaGuardia. I trust you with all my heart man. We had a conversation once about our futures. Inconsistencies. Me about Steph, you about the things you haven\'t experienced. I don\'t exactly remember in what context, but I remember saying ""if we make it."" You looked at me like I was crazy and stopped us from walking to where we had to go. You looked at me and set me straight. You told me ""when we make it."" Forever since that moment, I\'ve held that thought close. Especially since it was similar to a parallel my father often made. God said ""let there be light"", and there simply was. Nothing less. By continuing to think that way, we will be there in seconds. Best believe.\n\nMarquise Naipaul. It\'s funny how your name shortened is like the word ""mark"", and you\'re an illustrator. We\'ve had some great times man. You\'re one of the most level-headed, humbled young men I\'ve gotten to know. You do what you do with ease. And your strategy out of everyone in our crew has easily allowed us to never feel restrained by an issue. To Marq, usually we can just so quickly bypass it, because your wisdom is plainly, anything is possible. If one thing doesn\'t work with you, you just go with it. Maybe it wasn\'t meant to happen, if it is, it\'ll happen eventually. Well, it\'s happening now. I think it really is. And I\'m glad we got front row seats.\n\nNathaniel Singh, I\'ve been praying for you man. As upset as I am that you had to leave LaG and that you were so sick all those months, I\'m glad you\'re finally getting back on your feet. If you listened to the tape, you probably noticed there\'s an unfinished version of ""Make Believe"", and that\'s because we still gotta get together and do it. We need you Tanny. Our squad can\'t survive without you. You\'re such a humorous, friendly guy man. I\'m so sorry for the times you were going through during your absence. I know the world gets heavy on us sometimes and we\'d just prefer to drop the ball, but honestly man I love you to death. You gotta keep your head up and keep killing them with these hits. When we do finish ""Make Believe""—well, let\'s just say we won\'t be able to live normal lives anymore. We\'re not normal people Nate. None of us are. Nobody on this tape is normal and that\'s the genius of it. We\'re all a little bit insane man and that\'s the thing that makes me and you click. Hell, half the time we\'re talking to each other people feel like we\'re speaking a different language. And it\'s \'cuz we are. Sincere gratitude to your parents, your brothers and much love to you and your boy Ceddy.\nP.S. I heard about the possible Def Jam signing man. God\'s pulling up on the other side huh? How green is it over there? Peace man. Stay up.\n\n\n\nHouston Arriaga, I gave you that ""Star"" name and it fits well. I got to know you pretty well as the release of this whole thing approached. I\'m sorry we didn\'t get together sooner and that we still haven\'t finished ""Rescue"", but best believe when we do, we\'re gonna sit back and chill. Your presence is incredible. You\'re a very good spirit to keep around when times get tough. I appreciate that. You\'re strength precedes you man and I look up to you for that. Stay up brother.\n\n\n\nKar\'mel A. W. Smalls, I hope you like what I did with ""Two Truths and a Lie"". I kind of had to pull a full throttle on it since we weren\'t able to meet up and work on it the way I wanted and planned to. But I hope I still did it justice in your opinion. You\'ve showed me so much of your work man and truthfully I can\'t wait to see you blossom. Not just in music but with your swift dance and harmonious vocal talents. That no one has yet to hear. You, as well as Jharrel, are two people I\'m definitely planning on working with day after day after day. Your energies are beyond living—they\'re angelic. When we meet again we\'re both gonna be in the booth together. In the meantime, let\'s keep on growing.\n\n\n\nAlprentice Davis. We did it. We\'re finally moving forward. I used to talk about this all the time and we\'re finally in the studio doing everything I said we would. You got to be on a mixtape finally, you have a single of your own and aside that we\'re finally creating this label. I can\'t wait until you can meet up with Trav, Nate, Marq and Slim so we can all just change the world with this man. We\'ve known each other since we were in diapers practically. We\'ve got in trouble with each other. We\'ve written stories together. And though you may not be up here in NY as much anymore, best believe that whenever you are it\'s like you were never gone. We never got to graduate on the same stage, but Kindergarten was our practice step, for this. I don\'t know what my life would be like if I never met you. But, I\'m glad I got to. We need to stick together—we\'re the same blood—we\'re the same kids. We\'re brothers, and brothers don\'t abandon each other. Best buds for life.\n\nMike Martial, my ingenious engineer and mixer. You gave the sometimes rather blurry sounds of my conscience, clarity. You heard things for this project I never imagined. And as a producer and rapper yourself, you were able to give a tone to the project that added to the message in a greater manner than I ever originally was conveying on each track. Some of them didn\'t even sit well with me at first, but as I listened, things just got better and better. I\'m glad that my father and I met you. Your vigor changed this project into an unbelievable dream. Thank you for all your effort and constant work. Anything I ever do will always be brought to you.\n\nKester ""Kedar"" Lynch for your wise and always positive words for the project. You believed in it the moment I came to your door step and I\'m glad you were able to come along for the ride. Thank you for your time and effort on this project. You made sure you came to every Sunday session you could no matter what the circumstances. I\'ll never forget after financing us with all the Chinese food orders and your famous codfish delectable sandwiches—that you cooked a full meal for us and brought it all the way from Queens out to Brooklyn. That\'s commitment and that\'s the love you brought to us and shared with us every week. This project would have been so incredibly different without you. Your being brought such a family-like element to the studio. It didn\'t matter what was being recorded, there was never any judgement. There was just full honesty and continuous encouragement to make every track the very best it could be. You added to the most intricate details that made this whole thing up and with that I will forever be in your debt. I hope you will be able to return for that role in all my other ventures as time progresses. Peace, love and blessings my brother.\n\n\n\nTo Aja Eden Adam. We\'ve been through a lot. Sometimes more than I deserved. Sometimes more than you needed to deal with. But I\'m glad regardless of our struggles, we\'ve stayed friends. Your eye as a photographer has always interested me. Ever since I met you and knew you had that talent, I think I always knew I wanted you to photograph something valuable for me. I didn\'t know how important that photograph would be, but it turns out it was my first musical effort. I\'m glad you were able to be apart of this as well as help me for the filming of 14 St. I hope to work with you again in the same field or on maybe even something greater. Love you.\n\n\n\nStephanie Rios. ""Hey. Hello. Hi."" We used to greet in Crayola with ""Yellows!"" and ""Greens!"" but officially, those latter three words are the three ways I\'ve found I can\'t contact you. I haven\'t reached out to you in the longest and I guess that\'s because maybe I\'ve been working on this or I\'ve been seeing things differently. I\'m glad everything is going great for you where you are. And I hope when you see how much you—or rather the concept of you—is actually involved in this project, you don\'t take it the wrong way. Hopefully you see it the same way you saw ""The Tale"", because simply, that\'s what it is. You\'ve been someone I have always made sure I could keep an arm out to and also something I could keep a handle on. I shouldn\'t do that, I shouldn\'t have done that, but I do—I won\'t anymore really. There\'s a lot on here that I always tried to say to you through a text or a voice message, but maybe hearing it like this resonates purer and more clearly. We may never meet in person but at least we\'ll know what each other\'s voices sound like. You know? You\'re a beautiful Virgo angel whose intelligent, loving, motherly spirit was handcrafted by God himself. You are you. No one else. I\'m glad about that. I don\'t think I would have wanted to ever meet another Stephanie Rios. Hopefully you\'ll always remember that regardless of if I say so or he says so or someone else does. Hopefully even when people try to say otherwise, you\'ll know. Just know. Don\'t think about anything else but that. Doing you is what keeps you—I don\'t know—you. And I like that. You truly are the compass of this tape and the matriarch of it\'s beauty. You are the definition of this tape. You are Magnificent.\n\nMe: ""What do you want to be when you grow up Steph?""\nYou: ""Happy.""\n\nI agree with you. I mean what else can we be right?\nWe\'ll talk when we talk.\nMuch love from your boy, Rod.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------This tape was for your discretion. Anyone mentioned on this project in passing or blatantly was either used fictitiously or metaphorically for the sole purpose of relaying a message. To those brought up, I thank you for the ways that you impacted my life—whether that be positively, negatively or perhaps both. You\'ve made up who I am today—which though in some ways isn\'t satisfying—is also better than the boy I was yesterday...----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo the many others involved with this project:\n\nLorem Vercetti, I never was able to reach you but I wanted to pay my respects to your work man. There were a couple KAFP instrumentals that I sorted through and could\'ve taken use of, but yours was the most appealing to me.\n\nAlso to Jarion Alexander, who alongside being one of the very first producers I\'ve ever worked with on our promotional, ""The Tale"", did an amazing reproduction for Jharrel and I on ""2 On"". That rework on the second half of that song always jolts me into introspection.\n\nGiovanna Armstrong, I was first introduced to your work by my friend Kar\'mel. Holy hell, I love your ear for samples and ""Oncheezied"" was to date one of the greatest beats I had heard on your SoundCloud. I\'m glad I was able to get you on this project. Don\'t  even worry about it, we\'re gonna work together again in the future. Bet on it.\n\nDrew Williams, we weren\'t in contact very long, but from what I gained from you—I learned how hungry you are to do art and rise above, satisfying your ambitions. In that way, we are very similar. I hope you enjoyed what I did for your rework of ""What\'s the 411"" as well as my production alongside it. Truly loved the collaboration—this song will always be a favorite of mine.\n\nDJ Abomination, we\'ve contacted each other restlessly throughout the duration of this project. You\'re actually one of the first few producers I was interested in working with, as well as the first one I reached out to. Hope you loved the outcome of ""Defender of the Castle"", as well as Magnificent in general. It was fun tackling that instrumental as well as coming up with the right way to place it into the project\'s narrative. May the odds forever be in your favor man, you deserve it.\n\nIonut Olteanu, I\'ve fell in love with so many of your beats. Deeply sorry for the loss of your previous channel. I appreciate you allowed me to use your work for ""Osiris"" and even further, I\'m grateful that you allowed me that opportunity before your channel closed down. So much of your work hits hard and I can\'t wait to hear where you go in the future.\n\nAnd finally, A-Rayz Music. You were the final source I contacted on this project. After hearing some of your production through a schoolmate of mine, I had to actually speak to you. Your work on ""Carpe Diem"" was able to free me from a long amount of writers block I had while working on Magnificent. I was able to finish the project happily by writing to it. And inevitably, Carpe defined the ending of the whole experience. I was happy. I was smiling. And hopefully, our listeners were too!\n\n\nTo the over-arching inspirations:\n\nRobert Hall Jr., we briefly spoke on Twitter about me doing a cover of ""Hip 2 Da Game"". You\'ve always been a legend in my book. Though we lost communication after a couple weeks, I\'m so thankful and appreciate that you took the time to actually respond to me. You didn\'t have to, but by doing so you\'ve pushed me further in so many ways.\n\nMac Miller, the most dope. Your original version of KAFP was literally half my middle school years. I still listen to your stuff and I am so glad you\'ve found your spot in the industry and have planted your seat. You honestly deserve it after all the work you put in with those tapes man.\n\nDJ Mustard, your music is everywhere I look. Seriously. EVERYWHERE. Usually if I listen to satellite radio, at least twice your production tag pops up. That\'s how fast you get out hits and thats how much effort you put into your production. As a musician myself, you\'ve made me take notice of the types of vibrations music can create. With yours, it\'s always fun to listen to you—even if the concept and meaning in the song strays from that feeling—your production calls for people to party and enjoy their lives. Thank you for that introduction.\n\nTinashe, I remembered hearing of you in passing by so many of my friends or people I spoke to online. When you dropped ""2 On"", I finally listened to you. Forever more you\'ve had a fan. I\'m happy your career is skyrocketing and heading into such a positive direction and I hope that always continues.\n\nDrake, one of the few straight up inspirations for this tape. Much of the tape was written as you rose into the limelight. Your work showed me that Hip-Hop didn\'t have to just be Hip-Hop. It could be way more genres in just that one. You\'re actually the first artist I can really say in the past decade who really defined for me what ""Hip-Hop/R&B"" was. Not many other artists were really proving to me why that slash was there between the two genres. I was hearing each of them separately until you blew up. In so many ways, you\'ve showed me what music has grown to be and what it should continue to be. Hits.\nLin-Manuel Miranda, your arrival as well as you and your original cast\'s speeches to my school\'s cast over our production of In the Heights did a lot for me. You have such eloquent words and such a soft spoken yet energetic personality. Meeting you changed a lot for that song which among 2 others is still in production and this entire project. Your poetry and lyricism has gone as far as to be acclaimed by Broadway just as well as by mainstream artists. That is something I forever hold as an ambition I want my life to—if not at least reach—surpass.\n\nManu Chao, from the amount of work I\'ve heard in your album Clandestino and on, I can honestly say that your name deserves more credit than it already has. While I know that much of that album reached and touched simply the hearts of those in foreign Europe and Spanish countries, it reached all the way over into mine here in the United States. Your versatility in languages has also been a great influence in my work—in fact you\'ve caused me to take the concept of being bilingual and even trilingual very seriously now. I\'m terribly itching to hear another album drop by you.\n\nEddie Murphy, my king of comedy. I put you next to all the other greats. Cosby, Pryor, Cedric, Lawrence. But you\'ll always be my favorite. With just two stand-ups you showed the world how belligerent yet parodic comedy and even drama has the ability to be. While your music career is often overlooked and your acting career is often underpraised, I say confidently and proudly that all your work, including your films and music has inspired me in the realm of entertainment and always will.\n\nMary J. Blige, to date all the way back to your first album shows how much I love your work. To be short, your evolution has been jaw-dropping. ""What\'s the 411"", as classic as it was and still is—without a doubt is so different and diverse in nature compared to your most recent works. I was introduced to the final song of that album by the photographer of this project, Aja Adam, and since, was in awe and unable to fathom at times how point A What\'s the 411 got to point B The London Sessions. Your voice to me has affected my generation to the likes of Patti Labelle and Chaka Khan in my father\'s years of youth. If men could have your voice specifically if I could, I don\'t know how the world would respond.\n\nAnd to Joe McDermott, Allister Brimble, Nathan McCree and Keiichi Okabe, you are men who created the atmospheres and soundtracks of my childhood. You created the tunes I would hum everyday when I pretended to be in a zombie apocalypse, thought I could drive, wanted to venture into far off Egypt, practiced martial arts or just wanted to feel free from the stresses of my day. You also are one of the many inspirations for my original orchestrations and compostions. Thank you.\n\n\n\nAnd oh my Gosh! How could I ever forget yo?!\n\nHUGE shoutouts to PlayStation, Xbox, Windows and Macintosh. You are the realest of the real. The most underrated of the underrated. You all are harder than the coldest mountain peaks. YOU ARE THE REAL MVP\'S. You have had my back since birth pretty much. You all were the main homies who came in clutch for this tape to happen. Whenever I was upset, whenever I was feeling a little too cocky so I went online or whenever I was bored out of my mind, you kept me going. You gave me just as many nightmares as you gave me dreams, but I forgive you for that. Seriously. I should have never sat and watched my Dad play Resident Evil 2. It has tormented me into my teenage years to the point where the destruction of such an intellectual erudition and segment of my childhood makes me cry heavy rains of tears.Capcom...\nStop making RE games if you can\'t make them good.I\'m just joking around.\nThis was a pretty long letter anyway,\nI had to break at some point.\n\n\n\n\nAnd for the finale, to the main act who have sewn their souls and pure spirits so sweetly and courteously into this project: I thank you...\nWillow, Mama, my grandmother—for waking me up every morning for school when I was younger. For cooking my meals. For cleaning my clothes. For giving me words of wisdom and for teaching me how to do each of those things on my own as I\'ve gotten older and I\'m approaching manhood. Though I know you won\'t be here forever, I\'ve counted everyday I\'ve had with you and cherished you in every moment I can. Without you, I wouldn\'t be able to breathe. With you, every color is more colorful. Every word is more poetic. Our family is one because of you. We keep each other together. We look out for each other. When I come home I feel safest there because of your warmth and because of your uncontainable aura. I love you Mama, with every speck of my being.\n\nTack, Papa, my grandfather—for bringing laughs into my life. For showing me the importance of frugality as well as taking life slow. For teaching me to enjoy the little things. For mending some of the tools of my childhood and growth my game controllers, my action figures, my pens, my computers, my speakers, my keyboards,  and eventually my heart whenever it collapsed. Thank you for sharpening my eyes and ears, refining my mind and always telling me to analyze the world around me. Thank you for financing my dreams and believing in them no matter how far fetched you may have ever believed they were. You\'ve always made things happen for me. I\'ll pay you back one day. I promise. I will always remember you for that Papa. I will always hold you close to my heart.\n\nPrince, Daddy, my father—for leading me up this path to creativity and showing me just as many of the evils to avoid in this world as the beauties you\'ve taught me to take part in. Yes, we\'ve had rough patches. Whether it be at home, in the middle of the street, over the phone or even in the studio. We can tend to fight. We clash. But as hard as that gets sometimes, I still love you. I can\'t help but love you. This is just as much for everything you\'ve worked to be as it is for everything I want to be and I have to be. Yes, I\'ve runaway, yes, I\'ve argued and yes, I may downright not listen sometimes. I\'m a teenager. Sometimes, none of us can help it. I apologize. But, look at what we did. Look at how we got here. Look at where we\'re going. We\'re getting there. Don\'t you think she\'d be proud?\n\nAnd by she...\n\nI mean my mother. Sugar. Dulcey. I only knew you for a number of years. But, they were enough years to know you and always remember you. Thank you for bringing me into this world. Thank you for being here when you could. Thank you for being the benevolent soul I needed most when you came around. I wish you were here. Greatly. I wish you could sit here with us, laugh, smile and input your own ideas into things. But then again, you do. I listen back to tapes that have your voice on them. Ideas you were spawning on the spot or ideas you were returning to and they rouse some of the most interesting and unthought of ideas I\'ve ever had sometimes straight to me. Every once and a while I\'ll be sitting around just writing down lyrics or playing a song and I wonder where this specific note or that certain lyric precipitated from. Then I look up. And I think of you. Isn\'t it lovely?\n\n\n\nLastly to God.\n\nTo God,\n\nI obviously haven\'t done all I can.\nI obviously am less than a man.\nI say to you I\'ve been searching for you.\nWhy haven\'t you answered?\nI\'ve argued about you.\nArgued for you.\nI\'ve became so sore to your silence.\nHonestly it\'s so quiet.\nI\'m so tired I would rather sleep sometimes than to sit hear without sound it\'s,\nDead silent right here in my bedroom.\nI said to you the last time I prayed—\nI don\'t even remember what...\nSometimes I\'m discouraged\nAnd other times I like, resent not doing it.\nPeople say you don\'t exist.\nAnd though it seems you\'re proving it,\nIn that same dead silence you\'re proving us wrong.\nYou\'re here.\nYou\'re hearing us.\nYou\'re hearing us in your ears.\nWe\'re just not listening enough to hear you in ours.\nWe want you to cover our scars,\nBut you\'re telling us to do it ourselves,\nWe have to do just as much work as you for this to work.\nThis is a working relationship.\nOccasionally you\'re a fable to me,\nBut I know that you\'re there.\nI got so many quotes of you by my bedside,\nThat it\'s hard to truly say that I think you\'re a lie.\nBoy am I tired.\nI told you I\'m tired.\nSo tired but inside I\'m feeling the fire.\nPlease God could you answer?\nMy phones \'bout to die!\nBut even if it does I\'ll still wait for a reply.\nCause I\'ll climb to the highest mountain,\nAnd wait for the sun to rise,\nAnd hopefully there I\'ll hear a word from you by that time.\nBye bye.\n\nI couldn\'t say it to you in just simple syntax. So I had to write it out like that. If you\'ve gotten me this far, I\'ll wait to see how far it goes. I know you\'re taking care of me, and I hope you\'ll keep taking care of the people I need you to.\n\n\n\nThank you.\nThank you, thank you, thank you...\n\n\n\n\nI don\'t know what to say other than that.Embed', 'default'",3
